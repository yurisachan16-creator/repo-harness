// hook-guard-stability regression guard (2026-07-23 root-cause-prover
// diagnosis, .ai/harness/runs/hook-guard-stability/diagnosis-probes/).
//
// Root cause: resolveStableEffectiveState's stability contract
// (src/effects/state/resolve-effective-state.ts) compares the FULL
// source_hashes map -- including non-authority, high-churn surfaces such as
// checks/latest.json, tasks/current.md, handoff/resume, and the
// review_subject working-tree diff fingerprint -- between re-reads, and
// throws "workflow authority changed repeatedly while resolving effective
// state" whenever any one of them differs. The hook wrapper
// (src/cli/hook/runtime.ts) collapses that throw into `null`, which
// mutation-guard.ts cannot distinguish from a genuine blocker, so it fails
// closed with the generic "Deterministic workflow profile resolution
// failed" banner -- blocking innocent edits on ordinary concurrent work
// (bun test, git commands, evidence-cache writes) rather than on anything
// wrong with the plan/contract themselves.
//
// This guard proves both falsifier directions named in the task contract
// (tasks/contracts/20260723-0620-hook-guard-stability.contract.md):
//   (a) churn confined to a non-authority source must not abort resolution
//       or surface as the unresolvable-profile block.
//   (b) a genuine plan-contract conflict (the artifact-parsers
//       planContractRelationshipConflicts shape) must still block with
//       today's exact WorkflowProfileGuard message and exit code.
//
// On unfixed code, direction (a) is expected to be RED (the resolution
// throws under sustained non-authority churn, so `failure` is non-null and
// the assertions below fail); direction (b) already holds today and stays
// green across the fix. Only the DESIRED end state is asserted here -- no
// assertion encodes today's bug as expected behavior.

 *
 * The mutator first claims the given fake lock-owner file (created via
 * writeFixtureStateLock with this process's own pid, so it cannot be
 * reclaimed as stale), mutates the target once, signals "started", THEN
 * releases the fake lock -- guaranteeing the caller's own
 * resolveEffectiveState call (which blocks on the same lock) cannot begin
 * its own reads until at least one mutation has already landed -- and keeps
 * mutating in a tight loop with no delay until the stop file appears, so
 * every read taken during the caller's critical section observes fresh
 * churn regardless of host speed.
