# repo-harness AGENTS.md

This repository self-hosts the `repo-harness` contract; the former `repo-harness-skill` and `project-initializer` names have been fully removed and are no longer recognized by any tooling. Claude and Codex should follow the same repo-local workflow surface.

## Canonical Workflow Files

- `tasks/current.md` for the tracked current-status snapshot derived from workflow artifacts
- `tasks/todos.md` for deferred medium/long-term goals, not active execution checklists
- `plans/prds/` for upper-layer PRDs; `plans/sprints/` for ordered sprint backlogs operated through `repo-harness run sprint-backlog`; task contracts stay the execution slices
- `.archcontext/model/nodes/*.yaml` for the capability nodes and longest-prefix context boundaries, selected by `.ai/harness/policy.json#context.capability_source`
- `tasks/workstreams/` for capability long-running workstreams that project durable progress into local contracts
- `tasks/lessons.md` for correction-derived rules
- `docs/researches/` for deep repo knowledge
- `tasks/notes/` for task-local implementation decisions, deviations, tradeoffs, and open questions
- `plans/` for timestamped plans, with `plans/archive/` for history
- `.ai/harness/workflow-contract.json` for the installed workflow contract manifest
- `.ai/harness/policy.json` for the machine-readable workflow contract
- `.ai/context/context-map.json` for progressive context loading
- `docs/architecture/index.md` for umbrella architecture status, drift requests, snapshots, and diagram links
- `docs/reference-configs/agentic-development-flow.md` for parent-agent/Waza routing and P1/P2/P3 rules

## Operating Rules

- Sync `tasks/` whenever substantive repo changes are made.
- Use `tasks/notes/<plan-stem>.notes.md` only for non-obvious slice decisions, deviations, tradeoffs, and open questions; `<plan-stem>` is the active plan filename without `plan-` and `.md` (for example `20260531-0045-governance-workflow`). Do not use notes as durable memory or a task log, and archive/promote them deliberately when the slice closes.
- Treat hook execution as typed and user-level: `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.codex/hooks.json` invoke `repo-harness-hook`, whose route registry selects exactly one in-process handler. `.ai/hooks/lib/workflow-state.sh` is an operator-helper library, never a host-event dispatcher.
- Keep the umbrella hierarchy explicit: architecture owns stable truth, capability contracts own local agent context, `tasks/workstreams/<domain>/<capability>/` owns durable progress, and `tasks/todos.md` owns only deferred medium/long-term goals with tradeoff and revisit trigger.
- Treat `.archcontext/model/nodes/*.yaml` as the source of truth for capability prefixes under `capability_source: "archcontext"`; `agent-context-blocks.txt` and nested agent files are initialization inputs only, never runtime resolver authority.
- Keep architecture drift handling split: `architecture-queue.sh` writes architecture requests/events, `workstream-sync.sh` maintains durable capability workstreams, and `context-contract-sync.sh` only updates controlled local `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` architecture blocks.
- Keep `assets/workflow-contract.v1.json` and `.ai/harness/workflow-contract.json` in sync.
- Keep `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` short; put detailed guidance in `docs/reference-configs/`.
- Treat Codex auto-compact as a fallback only; use `.ai/harness/handoff/current.md` and `.ai/harness/handoff/resume.md` for long-task rollover.
- Treat `.ai/harness/checks/*.latest.{json,md}` and `.ai/harness/runs/` as ignored runtime evidence cache; commit durable conclusions in `tasks/reviews/`, `tasks/contracts/`, `tasks/notes/`, or `docs/researches/` instead.
- Treat architecture/spec/research docs as the human reading entrypoint. Before closing a workflow, promote durable conclusions into `docs/architecture/`, `docs/researches/`, `docs/spec.md`, or `tasks/lessons.md`; then archive fulfilled plan/contract/review/notes/todo artifacts so root workflow surfaces represent active work only. `.rgignore` hides archived workflow artifacts and runtime evidence from default `rg` searches; use explicit paths or `rg -uu` for audits.
- Treat `_ref/` as an occasional ignored external reference checkout cache, not a commit surface or daily workflow. Agents may read or refresh it for comparison; when it influences a decision, cite the source repo plus commit/tag and path in `tasks/notes/` or `docs/researches/`.
- Treat `deploy/` as the trackable deployment and operations surface for runbooks, submission materials, release checklists, helper scripts, ordered SQL files, and env examples; follow `.ai/harness/policy.json#operations.deploy_sql` for configured SQL roots and naming modes, otherwise keep SQL directly under `deploy/sql/` with 4-digit ascending prefixes.
- Treat `_ops/` as ignored local operations state for secrets, real env files, provider state, artifacts, logs, and scratch files; do not commit or agent-edit `_ops/*`.
- Treat contract-level task execution as worktree-first: `repo-harness run plan-to-todo --plan <approved-plan>` starts `repo-harness run contract-worktree start --plan <approved-plan>` when policy enables it, and completed blocks finish through Waza `/check` plus `repo-harness run contract-worktree finish`.
- Treat the EXECUTION_BOUNDARY anti-extras clause as mandatory on every delegated runner surface (contract worker prompts, the Codex delegation advisor hook, subagent start context, and MCP `codex-goal` documents): absent requirements are forbidden design space, not permission to improve, and unrequested extras fail closed.
- After Codex Plan mode, Waza `/think`, or `repo-harness-plan` produces a decision-complete work-package plan, capture it with `repo-harness run capture-plan --artifact-level work-package --slug <slug> --title <title>` so `plans/` becomes the file-backed source of truth; if the user has already approved implementation, capture with `--status Approved --execute --promotion-reason <merge_boundary|rollback_boundary|verification_boundary|risk_boundary|human_decision_boundary|worktree_boundary>` or run `repo-harness run plan-to-todo --plan <active-plan>`.
- Promote work into a top-level `plans/plan-*.md` only when `Artifact Level: work-package` is justified by a merge/PR unit, rollback surface, independent verification boundary, review/acceptance boundary, high-risk surface, or otherwise cannot remain a checklist item in the current active plan or sprint backlog. Inline sprint rows and checklist rows stay in the sprint backlog or active plan `## Task Breakdown`; contract rows may expand into plan -> contract -> review -> notes only through the work-package gate.
- If current repo state conflicts with the task, open an isolated `codex/<task-slug>` worktree, finish there, run Waza `/check`-style validation, then merge back to `main` without absorbing unrelated dirty changes.
- Route product discovery and complex/design planning to the parent agent: use `geju` for pre-contract framing, complete P1/P2/P3 with the parent agent's own capabilities, and freeze the accepted direction into the plan and contract. Route daily small/medium planning, bug hunts, and checks to Waza `/think`, `/hunt`, and `/check`. Route a proactive multi-direction visual/UX choice mid-task to the design-options convention (`repo-harness docs show design-options`).
- Codex automation profile is runtime-referenced, not vendored: required skills are `health`, `check`, and `diagram-design` from `~/.codex/skills`.
- Keep durable repo knowledge in `docs/researches/`, `tasks/lessons.md`, and the canonical workflow artifacts.
- Treat `.ai/harness/brain-manifest.json` and `repo-harness run sync-brain-docs` as explicit operator-invoked export surfaces only; hooks and workflow checks must not read, write, or gate on external brain-vault state.
- Treat Waza as Codex-first: `~/.codex/skills` is the Codex runtime source; `~/.agents/skills` is skills CLI staging/cache only. Update by staging upstream Waza, copying the eight managed `SKILL.md` files into Codex, and verifying with `cmp`.
- Use `docs/reference-configs/external-tooling.md` and `bash scripts/check-agent-tooling.sh --host both --check-updates` for environment checks; this self-host repo vendors CodeGraph as a dev dependency while generated downstream repos keep the global MCP default unless local policy opts in.
- When changing adoption planner or transaction code, verify `repo-harness init --repo . --dry-run` and a fixture apply use the same TS operation model.
- Treat repo-local `.claude/settings.json` and `.codex/hooks.json` hook adapters as retired legacy config; migration may back them up locally, but they are not product deliverables.

## Code Optimization Principles

- Reason from first principles: identify observable conditions, controllable inputs, the invariant, and the actual pressure point before changing structure.
- Keep one source of truth for each datum; every other representation must be a deterministic projection with a drift check.
- Do not add steady-state compatibility code, dual authority, semantic fallbacks, aliases, or shadow parsers. Explicit one-shot migrations must fail closed and remove the retired path in the same work-package.
- Create shared components only for observed reuse or a cross-module invariant. Prefer an existing monorepo workspace only when independently meaningful consumers need the shared package; do not convert this single-package repo without that boundary.

## Current Session Projection

- Durable progress lives under `tasks/workstreams/verification/evals-checks`.
- `tasks/current.md` is the tracked derived status snapshot; it is not a live lock or task source.
- `tasks/todos.md` is the deferred-goal ledger; current execution slices stay in the active plan's `## Task Breakdown`.
