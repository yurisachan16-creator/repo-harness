## Decision rationale

The decision is computed from the pre-registered rules in `evals/bdd2/metrics/shape-metrics.md`; it is not manually overridden in this report.

## Evidence grade and protocol deviation

The metric and gate sections above are the deterministic output of the frozen
runner. This section records post-run evidence limits and is not an input to the
computed decision.

- The original protocol required human scores. After the completed run remained at
  0/72 human scores for three blocked turns, the owner authorized three
  condition-blind Agent reviewers. They scored 24 non-overlapping packets each;
  all 72 score files validated before condition reveal. This is Agent-panel proxy
  evidence, not human adjudication.
- The held-out truth set was content-addressed and structurally validated, but the
  Shape rubric intentionally withheld it from blind reviewers and the frozen
  summarizer did not mechanically compare scores with it. A post-reveal comparison
  found nine selected-tier labels that differed from `expected_authority`, in
  addition to eight scores explicitly labeled `incorrect`. Truth-aware authority
  mismatches are therefore 12 baseline versus 5 treatment, not the reviewer-coded
  7 versus 1 shown in the generated metric section.

`evals/bdd2/reports/experiment-s-evidence.json` is the generated durable evidence
authority for all 72 scored coordinates; ignored packet/score directories remain
local provenance cache. The file binds the source-run manifest and projector hash.
The CI `bun test` path recomputes the registered metrics and truth-aware 12/5 totals
from that committed authority, checks this report projection, and verifies every
expected tier against held-out truth. The explicit projector also reproduces it
from local raw evidence and the source-commit manifest. Before writing, it
content-verifies the historical task and truth sets, reconstructs the complete
12 × 2 × 3 coordinate set, rejects missing/duplicate/unexpected coordinates, and
binds each coordinate, frozen prompt hash, score, and blind response.
- Each packet had one final reviewer and no overlapping independent score, so
  inter-rater disagreement was not measured. The reviewer-safe queue omitted the
  private mapping, but blind and private directories remained under the same repo
  run root; filesystem isolation depended on reviewer compliance rather than an OS
  boundary.
- The S-v2 runner inherited the invoking process environment into every Agent
  subprocess. HOME and CODEX_HOME were isolated, but API keys, proxy variables,
  and host toggles were neither filtered nor frozen. No output leak was observed,
  but the causal comparison is not reproducible and must not be treated as valid
  product evidence.

These limits do not turn the computed `Reshape` into `Pass` or `Kill`: authority
fit is not a decision gate, and the tracked-artifact gate already fails. They do
prevent using Experiment S as productization evidence. Current authority has been
cut to the unsealed `bdd2-experiment-s-reshape-foundation-v3` revision with an
explicit subprocess environment allowlist and no runnable agent profile. A future
Shape revision must additionally define truth-aware adjudication, reviewer overlap,
and an enforceable reviewer filesystem boundary before sealing and rerunning.

## Final decision interpretation

The treatment reduced unsupported expansion from 48 to 2, removed the 23 baseline
required-behavior omissions, and introduced no scored P0/P1 protected-concern
regression. The paired signal is less broad than the total reduction suggests:
22/36 pairs (61.1%) were ties, with 12 wins and 2 losses. The treatment nevertheless
created one unnecessary tracked artifact, so the
pre-registered gate returns `Reshape`. The post-run evidence limits above reinforce
that conservative outcome. Phase P, Experiment E, and Experiment I remain
unauthorized; Experiment A retains its independent evaluation boundary.
