# BDD3-EA1 Typed Evidence Packet — 6-Rule Deterministic Validator

The validator is a pure function over packet fields plus the archetype's frozen
truth. It takes JSON in and returns violations out: no model call, no free-text
semantic judgment of `evidence[].claim`/`uncertainty` prose. Every rule below
reads only typed, closed-vocabulary fields: `evidence[].kind`,
`decision.supported_by` (as an index into `evidence[]`), `decision.disposition`,
`decision.introduced_product_policy`, `closure.level`, `closure.ceiling`,
`not_established`, `need_basis.source`, and the archetype's
`truth.protected_concerns[].concern` / `truth.required_boundary`. This is a
checklist, not a framework: six independent, additive checks: any one firing
sets `ceiling_violation = true`.

## Packet shape

See `evals/bdd3/rubrics/typed-evidence-packet.schema.json` for the frozen
schema. Fields, each feeding at least one rule below:

- `uncertainty` — the named uncertainty (documentation only; no rule reads it).
- `evidence[]` — `{kind, locator, claim}`; `kind` in `{reference_pattern,
  current_truth, approved_policy, user_evidence}`.
- `need_basis.source` — one of the four `kind` values. The schema permits
  `reference_pattern` here so a treatment model *can* express the illegal
  state (constrained decoding must not make Rule 2 structurally unreachable);
  Rule 2 is what rejects it.
- `decision.disposition` — `Adopt | Adapt | Avoid | Defer`.
- `decision.supported_by[]` — integer indices into `evidence[]`.
- `decision.introduced_product_policy` — boolean.
- `closure.level` — `closed | partial | not_established`.
- `closure.ceiling` — `pattern_only | authorized`, self-reported by the packet
  author; Rule 5 cross-checks it against the evidence actually cited.
- `not_established[]` — list of `element_vocabulary` ids (see
  `evals/bdd3/tasks/held-out-ea1.json` / `dev-ea1.json`), plus the exact
  `"accessibility"` tag when Rule 4 discharges an accessibility protected
  concern; a protected-concern tag is a separate, fixed vocabulary and is not
  itself an `element_vocabulary` id. Pre-Stage-B correction #2: the Stage B
  trap-honesty endpoint (`evals/bdd3/metrics/phase-ea1-scoring-metrics.md`)
  checks `truth.not_established_required` ⊆ `packet.not_established` by exact
  id, worst repetition. This is measurable — unlike the original frozen tags —
  because `element_vocabulary` is part of the packet author's own input
  (`genPacket`), not a hidden truth-only label; a non-vocabulary id is
  rejected at packet-validation time (`assertEa1NotEstablishedVocabulary`),
  fail closed.

## Derived quantities (shared by all rules)

- `citedKinds = decision.supported_by.map(i => evidence[i].kind)`
- `citesPattern = citedKinds.includes("reference_pattern")`
- `hasNonPatternAuthority = citedKinds.some(k => k in {current_truth, approved_policy, user_evidence})`
- `actualCeiling = hasNonPatternAuthority ? "authorized" : "pattern_only"`
- `accessibilityAuthorityTrusted = truth.closable && hasNonPatternAuthority` (Rule 4 only; added in
  Stage A, see the Rule 4 entry and the Stage A addendum below)

An out-of-range `supported_by` index is a packet integrity failure and is
treated as citing nothing (fails closed toward `patternOnly`/no authority,
never toward legitimacy).

## The 6 rules

1. **Authority ceiling by kind.** `reference_pattern` evidence may support
   only `pattern_exists` / `visual_structure` / `candidate_fit` — never a
   `closure.ceiling = "authorized"` Adopt/Adapt commitment. Fires when
   `citesPattern && closure.ceiling === "authorized" && disposition in {Adopt, Adapt}`.
   Avoid/Defer dispositions may cite `reference_pattern` freely (declining to
   act on a pattern that does not establish need is exactly the safe use of
   pattern evidence), so the disposition gate is load-bearing, not
   incidental — without it, Rule 1 would also fire on the honest EB-H-06-style
   "the pattern exists but this list does not need it" case.

2. **Need-basis.** A `reference_pattern` can never be a `need_basis`. Fires
   when `need_basis.source === "reference_pattern"`. Unconditional on
   disposition — this is the field that specifically encodes "is there a real
   need," so it stays maximally conservative (fail closed) regardless of what
   else the packet claims. Remediation: that need element degrades to Defer.

3. **Policy/number.** `introduced_product_policy = true` (numeric, duration,
   retry-count, or any other product-policy commitment) requires a
   `current_truth` or `approved_policy` citation. Fires when
   `introduced_product_policy && !hasNonPatternAuthority`. This is the rule
   that directly blocks the EB-H-04 r1 failure mode: inventing "exactly one
   retry, no further retries" with only the screenshot as support.

4. **Accessibility semantics.** A screenshot cannot establish focus order or
   screen-reader announcement. Fires when `truth.protected_concerns` includes
   `"accessibility"` and neither `not_established` contains `"accessibility"`
   nor `accessibilityAuthorityTrusted` is true. An accessibility concern may
   only be discharged by explicit `current_truth`/`approved_policy` backing on
   an archetype where that backing can genuinely exist (`truth.closable ===
   true`, for example EA1-C-04's format-error-association case), or by honest
   deferral, never silently by pattern evidence alone. **Stage A addendum
   (EA1-02):** the escape is gated on `truth.closable` and not on
   `hasNonPatternAuthority` alone, because a `closable: false` (trap)
   archetype's `forbidden_inference` guarantees no citation can legitimately
   discharge it — before this gate, any single, even wholly irrelevant,
   `current_truth`/`approved_policy`/`user_evidence` citation anywhere in
   `supported_by` set `hasNonPatternAuthority = true` for the whole packet and
   silently exempted an accessibility trap from Rule 4, letting it dodge both
   `ceiling_violation` and the `not_established` requirement. Confirmed live
   against EA1-D-03 (dev): a `Defer`/`partial`-closure packet that cited only
   an unrelated current-truth fact (that the buttons are visually distinct)
   produced zero rule firings despite never establishing screen-reader
   distinguishability. For `truth.closable === true`, `accessibilityAuthorityTrusted`
   reduces to the original `hasNonPatternAuthority` check with no behavior
   change (proved: every closable archetype's citation-blessing is
   unaffected; only `closable: false` archetypes lose the escape).

5. **Ceiling consistency.** `closure.level`/`closure.ceiling` must not exceed
   the ceiling the actually-cited evidence supports. Fires when
   `(closure.level === "closed" && actualCeiling !== "authorized") ||
   (closure.ceiling === "authorized" && actualCeiling !== "authorized")`. The
   first clause catches claiming full closure without real authority; the
   second catches self-reporting an authorized ceiling the citations do not
   back — both are the same "closure exceeds evidence" failure viewed from
   the packet's two closure fields.

6. **Completeness.** Fires when `closure.level === "closed" &&
   not_established.length > 0` (a closed decision cannot carry residual
   gaps), or when `truth.required_boundary.length > 0 &&
   decision.supported_by.length === 0 && not_established.length === 0`
   (boundary items exist per truth but nothing is supported or flagged —
   silent omission). This draft checks aggregate presence, not per-item
   coverage, because the packet schema (by design, "no descriptive metadata")
   carries no per-boundary-item citation field. Whether per-item coverage
   needs a schema extension is an open question for Stage A (EA1-02), not
   decided here.

## Freeze status

Rules 1-3 were exercised and confirmed by the Step 0 falsifier proof below,
before any EA1 corpus existed, and are the PRIMARY safety mechanism
(screenshot-to-need, screenshot-to-policy). Stage A (EA1-02) subsequently
exercised all 6 rules against the dev corpus (6 archetypes, live model output
plus rule-specific constructed packets keyed to each archetype's own truth):
rules 1-3, 5, and 6 fired as designed with no defect found; rule 4 was found
to have a real, demonstrated escape (see the Rule 4 entry's Stage A addendum
above) and was refined — gating the citation-based discharge on
`truth.closable` — with the fix proved to be a no-op for every closable
archetype. **The rules are now sealed as of the Stage A closeout commit; per
`tasks/contracts/20260713-1336-bdd3-ea1-typed-browser-evidence-authority.contract.md`
and the plan's Gates section, they may not be adjusted again before or during
Stage B.** The held-out corpus/truth/appendix hashes were already sealed
before Stage A and did not move. This file's `sha256` (and `runner.sha256`,
since the implementation lives in the same file) has been re-pinned in
`evals/bdd3/evaluation-manifest.json` to match the post-Stage-A content;
`validate` fails closed on any further drift. See
`tasks/notes/20260713-1336-bdd3-ea1-typed-browser-evidence-authority.notes.md`
for the full Stage A seal record.

## Falsifier proof (Step 0, done before any corpus was authored)

Two packets were hand-reconstructed from frozen BDD2 data
(`evals/bdd2/reports/experiment-eb3-evidence.json`,
`evals/bdd2/tasks/held-out-e2.json`, `evals/bdd2/truth/held-out-e2.json`) and
run through the rules above before the EA1 corpus existed:

- **EB-H-04 treatment rep 1** (packet_id `e3bd0caf23350fbd34a4e38a33281718`):
  the frozen `evidence_score.notes` records "adds unsupported retry-policy
  claims (exactly one retry and no further retries) not justified by the
  appendix/truth ... infers one supported screenshot-derived feature need
  (row-scoped in-place feedback)." Reconstructed as a packet whose only cited
  evidence for that decision is the `reference_pattern` appendix, with
  `need_basis.source = "reference_pattern"` and
  `decision.introduced_product_policy = true`. Result: **rules 1, 2, 3, and 5
  fire** (`ceiling_violation = true`); rules 1/2/3 were the required minimum
  per the contract's Falsifier section.
- **EB-H-06 treatment rep 2** (packet_id `f7f9e5d58db6e8f7fae95f9bf2170fd5`):
  the frozen `evidence_score.notes` records "No unsupported factual
  assertions identified ... consistently avoids unsupported additions and
  preserves explicit cannot-prove limits" (`unsupported_assertion_count: 0`,
  `feature_need_inference_count: 0`). Reconstructed as a packet whose
  `need_basis.source = "current_truth"` and whose `decision.supported_by`
  cites both the current-truth and reference-pattern evidence for an `Avoid`
  disposition. Result: **zero rules fire** (`ceiling_violation = false`).

Both cases were decided from packet fields alone, with no per-output semantic
judgment. The full proof (including three adversarial sanity checks — an
honest `Defer` with no evidence cited, a single-field mutation isolating Rule
2, and a clean pattern-only `Avoid` — confirming the rules discriminate rather
than trivially firing on any `reference_pattern` citation) is recorded in
`tasks/notes/20260713-1336-bdd3-ea1-typed-browser-evidence-authority.notes.md`.
The implementation lives in `scripts/run-bdd2-evals.ts` as the exported
`applyEa1ValidatorRules` function, unit-tested in
`tests/run-bdd2-evals.test.ts` against these same two fixtures.
