# Task Contracts and Sprint Backlogs

Task contracts are the repo-local agreement between planner, generator, and evaluator.
Sprint backlogs are the ordered program layer that expands into task contracts.

## Three-Layer Glossary

The word "sprint" historically named a single execution slice in this harness. The current vocabulary is exactly three layers:

| Term | Layer | Artifact | Owner |
|------|-------|----------|-------|
| **PRD** | Product planning | `plans/prds/<stamp>-<slug>.prd.md` using `.claude/templates/prd.template.md`; lifecycle `Draft -> Approved -> Superseded` | PM + architect planning |
| **Sprint** | Program execution backlog | `plans/sprints/<stamp>-<slug>.sprint.md` (Source PRD + Architecture Notes + ordered Backlog + Execution Log) | PM + architect planning |
| **Task Contract** | Execution slice | `tasks/contracts/<plan-stem>.contract.md` plus its review/notes trio | One plan, one worktree |

- A PRD decomposes `docs/spec.md` intent into product direction, users, success criteria, acceptance scenarios, module behavior, data model, performance targets, and developer handoff. `repo-harness-product`'s PRD mode writes PRDs with compact/standard tiers and evidence rules for `[UNKNOWN]` / `[UNVERIFIED]` facts.
- A Sprint decomposes a PRD or `docs/spec.md` into an ordered backlog; each backlog task executes as one task-contract slice through the existing plan -> contract -> worktree -> verify flow.
- `tasks/todos.md` stays the deferred-goal ledger; it never carries the sprint backlog or any active checklist.
- Backlog row mode is a granularity decision. `contract` rows are allowed to become a top-level plan plus task contract only when they are captured as `Artifact Level: work-package` and pass the plan Promotion Gate. `inline` and `checklist-row` work stays inside the sprint backlog or active plan `## Task Breakdown` and must not generate contract/review/notes artifacts.
- Legacy filenames: `verify-sprint.sh` and `new-sprint.sh` predate the program layer and are kept for downstream compatibility. Read them as task-contract verification helpers. New generated artifact headings and plan metadata should use **Task Contract** and **Task Review**.
- Sprint lifecycle: `Draft -> Approved -> Executing -> Done -> Archived`, tracked in the sprint file's `> **Status**:` line. Use `repo-harness run sprint-backlog` for sprint operations; `.ai/harness/sprint/active-sprint` (runtime state, not committed) marks the single active sprint. Harness installs predating the sprint layer must upgrade the global/package runtime before invoking it. `repo-harness run check-task-workflow --strict` rejects Approved/Executing sprints whose PRD/source section is placeholder-only or whose backlog rows lack a concrete acceptance line.

## Inventory First

- Every execution-ready `plans/plan-*.md` should name the active plan, owning worktree, expected contract, review, notes file, deferred-goal ledger, `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`, `.ai/harness/runs/`, scope authority, plan switching rule, and worktree isolation path. Checks latest files are runtime evidence pointers/cache, not commit surface.
- Every execution-ready `plans/plan-*.md` should declare `> **Artifact Level**: work-package`, `> **Promotion Reason**:`, `> **Verification Boundary**:`, and `> **Rollback Surface**:`. It should also fill `## Promotion Gate` with the merge/PR unit, rollback surface, verification boundary, review/acceptance boundary, high-risk surface, and why this cannot remain a checklist row.
- Every `tasks/contracts/*.contract.md` should repeat the source plan, deferred-goal ledger, review, notes, checks, run snapshots, scope gate, and completion gate.
- If the inventory is incomplete, keep the plan in Draft or revise the contract before editing implementation files.

## Required Sections

- Goal
- Scope and non-goals
- Allowed paths
- Task Profile
- Delegation contract
- Exit criteria
- Verification commands
- Risks and rollback point

## Task Profiles

New task contracts should declare `> **Task Profile**:` before ownership
metadata. The profile sets the default human expectation for writable scope and
review focus.

| Profile | Default expectation |
|---|---|
| `code-change` | Runtime behavior may change within the contract's explicit allowed paths. |
| `bugfix` | Same allowed-path defaults as `code-change`; additionally requires a concrete `## Root Cause Evidence` section (`root_cause`, `repro`, `regression_guard`, `pre_fix_failure_artifact`) and passes an additional pre-fix failure evidence gate (see below). |
| `docs-only` | Documentation, plans, notes, and reviews only; `src/` and `tests/` are not allowed by default. |
| `ledger-closeout` | Close already-landed workflow evidence only; runtime source, tests, and hook paths are not allowed by default. |
| `migration` | Scripts, templates, assets, docs, and tests may change; preserve user-authored files. |
| `eval-only` | Eval, fixture, run, docs, and review surfaces only; runtime `src/` is not allowed by default. |
| `delegated-run` | Worker edits only contract-defined paths; parent remains the gate owner. |

Older contracts without `Task Profile` remain valid as legacy contracts, but
new generated contracts should include the field.

## Delegation Contract Fields

New contracts include a `## Delegation Contract` YAML block between allowed paths and exit criteria. This block is the forward-compatible contract-kappa surface for future delegated execution; it is metadata unless a runner such as `contract-run` consumes it.

- `budget`: optional limits for `tokens`, `runner_invocations`, and `wall_time_minutes`. `null` means the current session/default command limits apply. `wall_time_minutes` is a hard limit mechanically enforced via the bounded process runner deadline; a non-null `tokens` is REJECTED at preflight (contract-run has no token-budget enforcement mechanism, so it refuses to run with an unenforced constraint instead of silently treating it as advisory).
- `permission_scope`: the execution permission model. The default `mode: inherit_allowed_paths` means worker edits are limited by the contract `allowed_paths`; `writable_paths: []` means no narrower override; `network: inherited` means no new network permission is granted by the contract itself.
- `roles`: named responsibilities for `parent`, `explorer`, `worker`, and `verifier`. The parent remains the approval/checkpoint owner; explorer and verifier are read-only; worker may edit only within `allowed_paths` or a narrower `writable_paths` list. The verifier rubric is exactly the contract `exit_criteria`.

Existing contracts without this block remain valid. `repo-harness run verify-contract` continues to evaluate only the `exit_criteria` YAML block, so adding delegation metadata must not make old or new contracts fail verification.

## Root Cause Evidence Gate

As of this revision, `repo-harness run verify-contract` (and the equivalent `contract-run.ts` brief preflight) additionally evaluates the markdown `## Root Cause Evidence` section, but **only** when the contract's `> **Task Profile**:` header is `bugfix`. This is a deliberate, scoped expansion of the exit-criteria-only promise above: contracts with any other `Task Profile` (including contracts that omit the field entirely, which remain legacy passthrough) are unaffected and continue to be evaluated exit-criteria-only.

For a `bugfix` contract, the gate requires all four `## Root Cause Evidence` fields to be filled in with concrete (non-template) content:

- `root_cause` and `repro` must be non-empty and not the template placeholder text.
- `regression_guard` must name a test path that also appears under `exit_criteria.tests_pass`.
- `pre_fix_failure_artifact` must point to a file that exists, contains a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line, and contains the `regression_guard` path string. Capture it on the unfixed code with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — a pipe swallows the exit status). A passing run (for example one that only prints `0 fail`) does not satisfy this gate; the artifact must show the pre-fix failure with a nonzero recorded exit code.

Both `verify-contract.sh` and `contract-run.ts` implement this check independently against the same fixture expectations so that a `bugfix` contract cannot pass one gate while failing the other.

## Evidence Requirements Gate

New task contracts include a `## Evidence Requirements` fenced yaml block between `Allowed Paths` and `Delegation Contract`:

```yaml
evidence_requirements:
  benchmark: not_applicable
```

`benchmark` is a reviewed contract declaration, not an inference from `evals/harness/reports/profile-comparison.*` presence, changed filenames, or `Task Profile`. It accepts exactly two values, `required` or `not_applicable`. A missing `## Evidence Requirements` block, more than one such block in the contract, a missing `benchmark:` key, or any other value fails closed in AcceptanceReceipt evidence normalization, `workflow_benchmark_evidence_checks_match`, and `verify-sprint.sh`'s `benchmark_evidence.status` derivation. Unlike `Task Profile`, there is no legacy-passthrough exemption for an absent block.

## Acceptance Policy and Receipt

Every new contract freezes one reviewer and the waiver rule in a strict `## Acceptance Policy` JSON block. `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance` produces the final local evidence bundle; one semantic reviewer then returns `external_pass` or `reject`, or the named contract owner creates one typed UserWaiverGrant when the policy allows it. The grant binds the normalized contract and goal authorities, not a subject hash. Each user-waiver AcceptanceReceipt is then materialized from that grant and still binds the exact normalized implementation subject, verification and benchmark evidence, target revision, and reviewed paths. A semantic change invalidates the old receipt and requires fresh passing verification, but the same unchanged grant may materialize the new exact receipt without another owner prompt. Contract/goal authority changes or revocation invalidate the grant. Review Markdown is a deterministic projection, never authoring authority; user waiver never becomes external pass and never authorizes provider disclosure or merge.

Every new contract also carries exactly one strict `## Change Assessment` JSON
block. Its v1 shape is `{"protocol":1,"oracles":[...]}`; every oracle has a
stable id, one of `deterministic_test`, `runtime_readback`, or
`manual_acceptance`, and literal subject paths or `*`. Empty oracles are valid
only for a final subject that routes no risk. For every routed reason, an
allowed oracle kind must cover every selected path (or declare `*`); covering
one path in a multi-path reason leaves the other path in `oracle_gap`.
`manual_acceptance` is a legal declaration for human-facing acceptance context,
but it does not satisfy the machine-verifiable oracle required by
`authority_change`, `pattern_novelty`, or `irreversible_effect`. Change Assessment is recomputed
at `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, never from a Hook journal or model
judgment. It binds a `ReviewSelectionPacket` to the exact final subject hash,
policy review base, target revision, selected paths, reasons, and declared
oracles. Its closed reason set is `authority_change`, `irreversible_effect`,
`pattern_novelty`, `reviewer_disagreement`, and `oracle_gap`; an unmet oracle
blocks. `pattern_novelty` routes only additions in a rename-aware whole diff
relative to the policy base, not a token already present in final content or a
pure rename destination; untracked files are wholly new. Reviewer disagreement
is an append-only post-review escalation on the same packet, never a new
diff/base authority. After escalation, rerun `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`:
it revalidates the packet against a freshly recomputed base and puts the overlay
in canonical evidence. Finalization rejects a checks file whose assessment no
longer equals the current packet, so the prior evidence and receipt are stale.
The v1 cutover is intentionally fail-closed: an in-flight contract created
before this block existed must add and review its explicit declaration before
running the upgraded verifier; no compatibility oracle is inferred.

`AcceptanceReceipt` remains protocol 2 and the sole merge authority. It strictly
recomputes the active policy/contract base assessment from the exact final
subject before accepting an envelope; a self-hashed declared assessment or
packet is not sufficient. It binds
the packet through the canonical verification-evidence hash rather than adding
duplicate receipt fields. Because the packet carries the exact policy target
revision, any target movement requires fresh prepared verification before
acceptance can validate, even if the movement is otherwise non-overlapping.

- `not_applicable` preserves any existing benchmark report on disk and excludes it from this contract's acceptance and checks binding: the coupled review's `Benchmark Evidence SHA256` must read literally `not-applicable`, `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`'s `benchmark_evidence.status` must read `not_applicable`, and report presence no longer fails the checks match.
- `required` keeps byte-exact strictness: the current authoritative report's fingerprint and benchmark subject hash must resolve, and both the review's `Benchmark Evidence SHA256` and the recorded checks fingerprint/subject must match that current evidence exactly; a missing or drifted report fails.

## Verification Execution Boundary

`verify-contract.sh --read-only` is read-only for contract state writes only: it does not rewrite the contract `> **Status**:` line. It executes `tests_pass` with Bun and `commands_succeed` in a non-login Bash with `BASH_ENV` unset. One fixed absolute 600-second budget covers the whole invocation; each command records duration, exit status, signal, and timeout state, and expiry terminates the command's process group before the verifier returns. The budget is not a policy or environment knob.

Verification is an evidence consumer. `commands_succeed` must not launch profile benchmarks/providers, `init`, evidence-producer scripts, or substantive installs; the verifier rejects those command shapes before execution. Produce expensive evidence explicitly, validate its subject/provenance/bytes, then let `verify-sprint` consume that frozen artifact through `verify-contract --read-only`.

A verifier consumes already-produced evidence; it must not become the producer of expensive, runtime-heavy evidence (for example, a full multi-provider/multi-profile benchmark matrix). An authoritative matrix or similarly expensive one-time evidence run belongs outside `commands_succeed`: the author runs it once on a clean checkout before merge and commits the resulting tracked report (for example `evals/harness/reports/profile-comparison.json`/`.md`); the contract then verifies that report's bytes and provenance, not a live re-run.

## Cutover Package Discipline

Distilled from the Hook Runtime Diet sprint (HRD-03..05, 2026-07-20). Apply
to every contract that retires a script/module, renames a field, or moves an
authority.

1. **Pre-enumeration gate (one amendment round).** Before any code, grep the
   retired filenames AND the surfaces they write across `src/`, `scripts/`,
   `tests/`, `docs/`, `README*` (all locales), `assets/`, `.ai/hooks/`.
   Classify every hit live vs historical with evidence in the notes file.
   Hand back the enumeration for exactly one Allowed Paths amendment round;
   reactive widening across gate rounds is the failure mode this prevents.
2. **Falsifier first.** Port the two smallest units first and byte-diff them
   against the base SHA before touching the main body; if they need a
   subprocess or shell-only semantics to stay observable-identical, stop.
3. **Full suite before reporting.** Scoped test groups are for iteration
   only. The worker runs the complete `bun test` plus projection/type/
   boundary checks before claiming RESULT; scoped-green with full-suite-red
   is a known CI blind-spot pattern.
4. **Composition fixtures.** Parity suites must include end-to-end cases
   through the production entrypoint (`runHook()` or equivalent) and
   combined-feature differentials; single-feature fixtures miss joins,
   budget filtering, and entrypoint drops.
5. **Golden delta policy.** A characterization golden regenerates at most
   once per package under a per-field authorized policy: runtime-shape
   fields may move where contracted, decision-semantic fields never move,
   and the per-field before/after lands in the notes and PR body.
6. **Dead-code claims need base-SHA proof.** A cleanup advisory (including a
   gatekeeper's) is a claim: prove deadness against the base SHA's owning
   function and grep for real exercisers before dropping; refuse with
   evidence otherwise and record the adjudication in the contract.

## Status Rules

- `Pending`: drafted but not approved for execution
- `Active`: approved for implementation
- `Blocked`: waiting on a missing dependency or decision
- `Verified`: all machine checks passed; awaiting or holding review
- `Archived`: sprint is complete or superseded

## Review Coupling

- A contract is not truly done until its typed `AcceptanceReceipt` records a contract-allowed final disposition.
- `tasks/reviews/<plan-stem>.review.md` is a human-readable projection of the typed `AcceptanceReceipt` plus any manual observations. It is not an authoring authority. The receipt binds `Reviewed Subject SHA256` with scope `normalized-final-content`; its canonical verification evidence includes an exact-target `ReviewSelectionPacket`, so any target revision movement requires fresh prepared verification.
- `tasks/notes/<plan-stem>.notes.md` captures task-local decisions and should be archived or promoted deliberately, not left as hidden long-term memory.
- Closeout is promote-then-archive: durable truths move into `docs/architecture/`, `docs/researches/`, `docs/spec.md`, or `tasks/lessons.md` before `archive-workflow.sh` moves fulfilled plan/contract/review/notes/todo artifacts into `plans/archive/` and `tasks/archive/`.

### Manual Check Evidence

`exit_criteria.manual_checks` remains a scalar list of exact requirements. Every manual
criterion must have one exact matching item under the coupled review's
`## Manual Check Evidence` section. Semantic acceptance is never represented as a
manual-check string; it lives only in the typed `AcceptanceReceipt`:

```markdown
- [x] Paid tenant can reopen the saved view after refresh
  - Evidence: Chrome run 20260710-1130, screenshot artifacts/refresh.png
```

The checkbox must be checked and `Evidence:` must contain a concrete observation,
command result, screenshot/artifact path, or reviewer note. Missing, unchecked,
text-mismatched, empty, or placeholder-only evidence fails closed. A summary elsewhere
in the review does not satisfy this gate; copy the contract requirement exactly so the
evaluator never guesses semantic equivalence.

## Worktree Lifecycle

- When `.ai/harness/policy.json` has `worktree_strategy.auto_for_contract_tasks: true`, `repo-harness run plan-to-todo --plan <approved-plan>` starts a linked `codex/<slug>` worktree instead of mutating the primary tree.
- `contract-worktree start` records the exact source `HEAD` as `base_commit` in
  `.ai/harness/worktrees/<slug>.json`. `verify-sprint` uses that immutable commit as its
  default branch diff base, so later base-branch or `origin/main` drift cannot add
  pre-task commits to `allowed_paths` evaluation. Explicit `REPO_HARNESS_DIFF_BASE`,
  `HARNESS_DIFF_BASE`, and CI `GITHUB_BASE_REF` values retain precedence. Legacy
  metadata without `base_commit` first resolves the last reachable commit before its
  recorded `started_at`, then falls back to the recorded `base_branch`; the next fresh
  worktree start records immutable provenance.
- Execute the sprint in that linked worktree. The primary worktree remains a merge target and must stay clean before merge-back.
- After implementation, run `repo-harness run verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, obtain exactly one semantic disposition from the contract-frozen reviewer (or an explicitly allowed typed user waiver), record the `AcceptanceReceipt`, then run `repo-harness run verify-sprint`. The final verification projects the receipt into the review file. The finish command consumes that same receipt, creates a provider-free exact local seal, applies the allowlisted lifecycle archive, and publishes one synthesized target commit whose tree is byte-identical to the verified lifecycle HEAD. The target base must remain frozen and its worktree must remain clean through publication.

## Publication Granularity

- The public history unit is one work-package, not one agent checkpoint, verifier transition, receipt projection, or archive step. `contract-worktree finish --merge` therefore adds exactly one commit to the target branch for the complete verified package.
- Checkpoint commits remain legal on the linked source branch. They provide recovery and red/green traceability while work is active, but local publication does not copy their topology into the target branch. `finish --no-merge` deliberately retains them because PR shipping owns the later provider merge/squash boundary.
- Product code, regression tests, required documentation, deterministic generated projections, and workflow closeout belong to the same publication commit. Standalone `WIP`, `fixup!`, `squash!`, acceptance rebind, contract fulfillment, review finalization, projection refresh, and archive-closeout commits are process state and must not land as target history.
- A second public commit is allowed only for an external fact that cannot exist before publication, such as package-registry, deployment, notarization, or store readback. It may update only release/deploy/readback evidence and must not change product code, tests, or contract semantics.
- Do not enforce granularity with changed-line or changed-file thresholds. A one-line correction may be a complete work-package; the deciding boundaries are independent rollback, verification, approval, consumer, and release ownership.
- If two changes have independent rollback or acceptance boundaries, split them into separate work-packages rather than preserving multiple commits inside one package publication.
- A synthesized publication honors `commit.gpgsign=true` by invoking `git commit-tree -S`; signing failure or an invalid signing-policy value aborts before target mutation. Repositories that do not configure signing retain the ordinary unsigned commit-tree path.
- If the verified lifecycle tree already equals the frozen target tree, finish refuses to create an empty publication commit. Resolve the already-landed work-package through the explicit no-op/cleanup path instead of manufacturing public history.
- Once target publication lands, any later in-process assertion or journal-write failure retains the source lifecycle state and in-progress journal. `recover reconcile` completes that exact effect; automatic abort may run only before publication is observable.
- Recovery recognizes only one legacy shape: an in-progress pre-cutover finish journal with no `publication_prepared` phase whose recorded lifecycle HEAD is already an ancestor of the target. Keep this probe through the next major release so operators can `recover abort|reconcile` interrupted upgrades; before that major upgrade, resolve every such journal. Remove the fallback in that major once the transaction store contains no matching in-progress journal.
