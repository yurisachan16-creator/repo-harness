# Design Options

Turn a genuine multi-direction visual/UX decision into a choice for the user
instead of an agent pick. The agent gathers reference evidence, generates 2-3
preview variants, and presents them without closing the decision; the user's
choice is the only event that closes it. If no human is available to choose,
the agent presents the options and stops — it never auto-selects, and it
never recommends one option over another.

## When This Fires

Fires only when ALL of these hold:

- A genuine design/UX/visual decision is in play: layout, component style,
  visual hierarchy, information architecture, interaction pattern, or
  aesthetic direction.
- 2-3+ real alternatives exist.
- The pick is a taste, brand, or product-fit judgment the agent must not
  close from evidence alone.
- A visual preview would materially help the user decide.

Does NOT fire on:

- One-correct-answer tasks.
- Purely logical or backend decisions.
- Directions the user or a design brief already specified.
- Bug fixes or refactors.

## Lineage

This is not a revival of BDD² and not a rescoring of BDD3-EA1 or BDD3-PS1;
their evidence stays byte-frozen and authoritative. Three sealed experiment
rounds killed the machinery this convention deliberately avoids:

- BDD² Phase E killed the inline Shape card, Behavior Audit, Browser
  Evidence Adapter, ImageGen Prototype Adapter, and a generic counting
  linter — each failed because the AGENT tried to close a preference or
  feature-need question with synthetic evidence
  (`docs/researches/20260713-bdd2-phase-e-closeout.md`).
- BDD3-EA1 killed a typed evidence-authority packet plus a 6-rule
  deterministic validator — enforced validator machinery tripped on
  legitimate work at Stage B scale
  (`docs/researches/20260714-bdd3-ea1-typed-evidence-authority-outcome.md`).
- BDD3-PS1 killed a protected-concern ledger with its own hold-correctness
  validator — the same enforced-machinery failure mode, this time as a
  lifecycle/ledger
  (`docs/researches/20260714-bdd3-ps1-protected-shape-outcome.md`).

The direction adjudication between BDD² and BDD3
(`docs/researches/20260713-bdd3-ea1-direction-adjudication.md`) reframed
Chrome MCP and image generation as plain host tool calls, not bespoke
product surfaces, and explicitly left open a "prototype generation + human
response capture" path where the human closes the decision. This convention
is that path: tools stay plain host calls, authority ceilings stay guidance
prose applied by judgment, there is no ledger/lifecycle/sidecar/catalog, and
the human — never the agent — closes the preference question. It does not
unlock I3 or Phase P.

## Step 1: Reference Evidence

Gather real-world reference patterns with the browser (Chrome MCP, or the
equivalent host browsing capability) as a plain host tool call — not an
adapter, not a pipeline, not a scored evidence packet.

Authority ceiling — guidance the agent applies by judgment; nothing enforces
it:

- Reference and screenshot evidence MAY establish: pattern-exists,
  visual-structure, candidate-fit.
- It may NEVER establish: feature-need, product-policy,
  numbers/durations/retries/thresholds, or accessibility semantics.
- When a candidate direction would need one of those claims to stand, mark
  it not-established and route the question to the user instead of
  asserting it.

## Product Boundary Prerequisite (Before Step 2)

Before any preview variant is generated, freeze the product boundary this
decision must stay inside. This gate runs once, after Step 1 evidence and
before Step 2 variants; it is not itself a design decision, and image
generation must never be used to explore or discover a missing piece of it.

Freeze all of the following:

- Audience / role: who sees this surface, and under what role or permission
  level.
- Requested user-visible outcome: what the user accomplishes, in one line.
- Product rules that must not change: existing behavior, semantics, and
  constraints this decision may not alter.
- Non-goals / forbidden extras: what this decision explicitly does not
  include.
- Allowed visible concepts: the concrete set of UI concepts, states, and
  controls this direction may show.
- Backstage-only concepts: concepts that exist in the product (admin views,
  debug panels, internal roles, unshipped states) that must never appear as
  if user-visible in a preview or in an implementation drawn from one.
- Required failure/recovery/accessibility behavior: the error, retry,
  empty, and accessibility behavior that must be present regardless of
  which direction is chosen.

If any of these is missing or undecided, stop here and resolve it with the
user (or the owning PRD/design brief) before Step 2. A gap in this boundary
is a question for the user, not a prompt for the model.

## Step 2: Variant Generation

Render preview variants with the host's image generation as a plain host
tool call, one variant per direction.

- 2-3 variants. Never more than 3.
- Never generate variants for a single-direction decision — with only one
  direction there is nothing to choose between, so Step 1 evidence stands on
  its own and this step does not run.
- Label every image STIMULUS: a prompt for the user's reaction, not a
  proposal or a finished asset.
- Give each variant a one-line tradeoff.

## Step 3: Presentation

Present:

- The decision, in one line.
- Each option: its preview, the ceiling-honored evidence citation from Step
  1, and a one-line tradeoff.
- An explicit "what I am NOT concluding" statement naming the taste/brand/
  product-fit question the user is closing, not the agent.

Do not pick. Neutral decision factors are allowed — "if X matters more, A
fits better; if Y matters more, B fits better" — a recommendation is not:
"I'd go with A" or "A is the better choice" have no place here.

## Step 4: Choice Capture

Record the user's pick as `user_evidence`:

- If a plan is active, append it to that plan's
  `tasks/notes/<plan-stem>.notes.md` — reuse the existing notes artifact, do
  not create a new artifact type.
- If no plan is active, record it as a one-line inline decision in the
  response instead.

Record the chosen option, the date, and that a human closed it. Never cite a
synthetic preview image as authority for the choice itself — the image was
stimulus, the user's pick is the evidence.

## Fallback: User Absent

If nobody is present to choose after Step 3, present the options and stop.
Never auto-pick, never default to one option, never treat silence or a
timeout as approval, and never proceed to implementation until a human
closes the choice.

## Taste Refinement Authority Ceiling

Once a direction is chosen (Step 4), a taste-class skill (for example
`design-taste-frontend`, `gpt-taste`) may refine its presentation. This
ceiling governs what that refinement pass may apply directly versus what it
may only propose back to the human:

| Refinement scope | Authority |
|---|---|
| Visual hierarchy, spacing, typography, color/token application | Apply directly |
| Component selection for an already-frozen interaction | Apply directly |
| Presentation of already-frozen interactions and copy | Apply directly |
| Features, states, or roles not in the frozen boundary | Proposal-only |
| Routes, fields, or settings | Proposal-only |
| Product policy or persistence semantics | Proposal-only |
| Retry rules or diagnostic modes | Proposal-only |

A refinement pass that would touch a proposal-only row returns it labelled
`PROPOSED_PRODUCT_CHANGE` instead of applying it directly — the chosen
direction's frozen scope does not expand by taste judgment. This ceiling
applies to any refinement-provider skill invoked after Step 4, including but
not limited to the two named above.

## Design-Brief Hand-off

The chosen direction feeds the existing `design-brief.template.md` /
frontend `task_profile` gate as its decided direction — this convention does
not duplicate that checklist.

## Worked Example

**Trigger.** The task is "build the settings screen for eight configuration
groups." Three real layout directions exist (tabs, sidebar nav, accordion),
the pick is a taste/information-architecture judgment, and a preview would
help. All four trigger conditions hold — proceed.

**Step 1 — reference evidence.** The browser tool visits three live settings
screens that use each pattern. Findings: a tabbed pattern-exists in product
A; a sidebar-nav pattern-exists in product B; an accordion pattern-exists in
product C. All three are candidate-fit for eight groups. Ceiling honored:
the evidence does not establish which pattern this product's users prefer,
so that claim is left to the user, not asserted.

**Step 2 — variant generation.** Image generation renders three previews:

- STIMULUS A — Tabs. Tradeoff: fewer clicks per group, but eight tabs crowd
  a narrow header.
- STIMULUS B — Sidebar nav. Tradeoff: scales cleanly past eight groups, but
  costs horizontal space on narrow viewports.
- STIMULUS C — Accordion. Tradeoff: works on mobile without a layout
  change, but hides everything below the fold by default.

**Step 3 — presentation.**

> Decision: which navigation pattern organizes the eight settings groups.
>
> - **A — Tabs** [preview]. Evidence: tabbed pattern-exists and is
>   candidate-fit (Product A, screenshot). Tradeoff: fewer clicks, crowds a
>   narrow header at eight items.
> - **B — Sidebar nav** [preview]. Evidence: pattern-exists and is
>   candidate-fit (Product B, screenshot). Tradeoff: scales past eight
>   groups, costs horizontal space on narrow viewports.
> - **C — Accordion** [preview]. Evidence: pattern-exists and is
>   candidate-fit (Product C, screenshot). Tradeoff: works on mobile
>   unchanged, hides content below the fold by default.
>
> What I am NOT concluding: which tradeoff matters more for this product's
> users, whether eight groups will grow, and whether narrow-viewport usage
> is common enough to weigh — those are yours to weigh, not evidence I can
> close from three reference screenshots. If mobile usage matters more, C
> avoids a layout change; if discoverability matters more, A or B keep every
> group visible at once.

**User picks B.**

**Step 4 — choice capture.** Recorded in `tasks/notes/<plan-stem>.notes.md`:

```
user_evidence: settings navigation = sidebar nav (option B)
date: 2026-07-14
closed_by: user (chose over tabs/accordion; ceiling-honored evidence in
  Step 1, no synthetic image cited as authority)
```

**Downstream.** The frontend task_profile / design-brief for the settings
screen cites "sidebar nav, per `tasks/notes/<plan-stem>.notes.md`" as its
decided direction — not the ImageGen preview.

**Absent-user branch.** If nobody is present to choose after Step 3 presents
the three options, the agent stops there. It does not pick B by default,
does not treat the strongest evidence citation as a tiebreaker, and does not
proceed with implementation until a human closes the choice.
