# Check Reference: Deploy Readiness

Source facade: `assets/skill-commands/repo-harness-deploy`.

Use for a focused deployment and operations configuration check for the
repo-local harness.

## Protocol

1. Confirm the target repo path and keep the pass read-only by default.
2. Read `.ai/harness/policy.json` and resolve the optional `operations.deploy_sql` contract before inspecting SQL paths. When absent, use `deploy/sql/` with `ordered4` names; when present, its roots, naming modes, and `invariant_file` are the sole alternate layout authority.
3. Check the tracked deployment surface: `deploy/`; roots named by `operations.deploy_sql.roots` when configured, otherwise `deploy/sql/`; `deploy/env/.env.example`; release, submission, or runbook files when present.
4. Check the private operations boundary: `_ops/` is ignored; real env files, secrets, provider state, artifacts, logs, and scratch files stay under `_ops/`.
5. Run `repo-harness run check-deploy-sql-order`.
6. Report readiness gaps as concrete missing or misplaced files, not as an app deployment attempt.

## Failure Modes

- If `_ops/` contains required private state, report the path class without printing values.
- If `operations.deploy_sql` is malformed, stop at the policy error instead of guessing a layout.
- If deploy SQL order fails, stop at `check-deploy-sql-order.sh`.
- If the user asks to publish or deploy, route to the project release/deploy process instead of this read-only check.

## Boundaries

- Read-only by default.
- Does not publish or deploy.
- Does not migrate `_ops/` assets into `deploy/` unless the user explicitly asks for a repair/migration.
- Does not inspect or print secrets, tokens, or real environment values.
- Does not replace the rest of the check workflow; it only covers deploy and operations readiness.
