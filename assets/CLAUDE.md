## Current Session Projection

- Durable progress lives under `tasks/workstreams/workflow-engine/contract-assets`.
- `tasks/current.md` is the tracked derived status snapshot; it is not a live lock or task source.
- `tasks/todos.md` is the deferred-goal ledger; current execution slices stay in the active plan's `## Task Breakdown`.
