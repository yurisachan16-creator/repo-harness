# Setup Mode: Scaffold

Source facade: `assets/skill-commands/repo-harness-scaffold`.

Use when the user asks to create a new project, app, or module skeleton.
Run the shared preflight in `../SKILL.md` first.

## Protocol

1. Confirm the target parent path, project name, plan catalog entry, and package manager.
2. Use the plan catalog A-K from `assets/plan-map.json`.
3. If the app needs agent runtime structure, select `ai_native_profile` as an overlay; otherwise keep the default `none`.
4. Run `scripts/init-project.sh` or the matching stack template path.
5. Attach the tasks-first workflow through the same contract install path used by init.
6. Verify scaffold output and workflow checks.

## AI-native Overlay

The AI-native profile is an overlay, not a new plan code. Keep A-K for project
type, then use profile values such as `runtime-console`, `product-copilot`, or
`sidecar-kernel` to document agent UI protocol, Bun/Hono gateway, AG-UI event
transport, assistant-ui or CopilotKit surfaces, contracts, observability, and
MCP/HTTP sidecar boundaries.

## Failure Modes

- If no A-K plan fits, use Plan K and record the explicit stack choices.
- If the overlay would make product authority unclear, leave `ai_native_profile` as `none`.

## Boundaries

- Do not expose `create-project-dirs` as a public command; it is the internal directory/helper installer.
- Do not expose a separate AI scaffold command; this mode owns the overlay.
