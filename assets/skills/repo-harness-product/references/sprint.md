# Product Mode: Sprint

Source facade: `assets/skill-commands/repo-harness-sprint`.

Use to plan a program-level Sprint from an upper-layer PRD or source spec and
execute its tasks through the existing task-contract flow. Sub-routes:
`plan`, `from-prd`, `run`, `status`. Run the shared preflight in
`../SKILL.md` first, then also read `repo-harness run sprint-backlog status`
when present.

## Protocol

1. Route `plan` (default when no sprint is active):
   - Discuss the product direction with the user from two named perspectives before writing anything: product (problem, users, success criteria, acceptance scenarios, non-goals) and architecture (capabilities touched, dependency order, risks, slice granularity).
   - Run `repo-harness run sprint-backlog init --slug <slug> --title <title>`, then fill `## PRD`, `## Architecture Notes`, and the ordered `## Backlog` table from the upper-layer PRD or source spec; every row needs a concrete machine-checkable acceptance line and a mode (`contract` or `inline`).
   - Present the draft sprint to the user. Only after explicit approval set `> **Status**: Approved`; `check-task-workflow.sh --strict` rejects placeholder PRDs, placeholder acceptance lines, and duplicate backlog rows.
2. Route `from-prd` when the user gives `plans/prds/*.prd.md`:
   - Read the PRD `Problem`, `Users`, `Success Criteria`, `Acceptance Scenarios`, and `Non-goals`; summarize them into the Sprint `## PRD` section and set `> **Source PRD**:` to the PRD path.
   - Derive backlog rows from `Module Behaviors (P0)` and acceptance scenario groups. Preserve dependency order and make every acceptance line traceable to a PRD acceptance scenario.
   - Keep discussion focused on ordering, slice granularity, and mode selection; do not re-decide the product intent unless the PRD has blocking contradictions.
   - Use `contract` rows for one plan -> contract -> worktree cycle. Split larger work at stable integration boundaries.
   - Acceptance lines must be machine-checkable, such as a test command, file existence assertion, grep pattern, or numeric assertion. Avoid subjective wording such as "works well".
   - Default mode is `contract`; use `inline` only for small isolated documentation, configuration, or single-file changes.
3. Route `run` (incremental, one backlog task per invocation):
   - Run `repo-harness run sprint-backlog next` to resolve the next pending row; when it exits 3, report the backlog as complete and recommend setting the sprint Status to Done after review.
   - Treat the row as a long-task waypoint, not a detailed implementation plan.
   - For `contract` rows, invoke `$think` with the sprint path, row task, mode, acceptance line, and Promotion Gate fields so the coding agent expands it into a decision-complete plan. Capture the approved `$think` output with `repo-harness run capture-plan --artifact-level work-package --promotion-reason worktree_boundary --source waza-think --source-ref sprint:<sprint-file>#<task> --status Approved --execute`.
   - For `inline` rows, do not create a new `plans/plan-*.md` or task contract. Keep the work in the sprint backlog or the current active plan's `## Task Breakdown`, then complete the row when the acceptance line is verified.
   - `repo-harness run sprint-backlog start-task` remains a compatibility helper for reserving a row. It captures a thin plan seed only for `contract` rows; inline rows append checklist-row content to the current active plan before recording an in-flight marker.
   - Execute contract slices as usual (implement, `/check`, external acceptance, `repo-harness run contract-worktree finish`); finish back-fills the backlog row warn-only.
4. Route `status`: report `repo-harness run sprint-backlog status` plus the Active Sprint section of `tasks/current.md`; mutate nothing.
5. After each completed task, re-read the sprint file before starting the next one; user edits to the backlog override stale session memory.

## Delegation Brief

Each `contract` row's `tasks/contracts/<stem>.contract.md` is the authoritative delegation brief once `$think` expands it and hands off implementation, not the sprint backlog row text. Fill in `## Why`, `## Goal`, `## Scope`, `## Stop Conditions`, `allowed_paths`, and `exit_criteria` before dispatching a file-coupled worker, and verify completeness with `repo-harness run contract-run preflight --contract <contract-file>`.

## Failure Modes

- If no sprint file exists and the user asked for `run` or `status`, report that no sprint is active and route to `plan`.
- If the backlog table is malformed or `check-task-workflow.sh --strict` rejects the sprint, stop and fix the sprint file before starting any task.
- If `start-task` fails after the plan was captured, report the orphan plan path and stop instead of retrying blindly.
- If a task contract is already executing in this worktree, finish or archive it first; never stack a second backlog task on top of it.

## Boundaries

- Contract rows flow through the existing plan -> contract -> worktree -> verify gates; inline rows stay in sprint/active-plan checklist scope.
- Never bypasses `/check`, external acceptance, or `verify-sprint.sh` to mark a backlog row complete.
- Goal mode (`run --goal`, autonomous continuation) is not part of this mode yet; treat requests for it as future work and say so.
- Do not run two backlog tasks in parallel: concurrent contract rows merge-conflict on the sprint file's Updated and Execution Log lines; the backlog is an ordered queue.
- Approval gating for this mode: see `../SKILL.md` Boundaries (Status: Approved always needs explicit user approval).
