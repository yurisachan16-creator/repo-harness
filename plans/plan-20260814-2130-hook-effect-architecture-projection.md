## Goal

Accept the verified flow-proof delta introduced by the hook effect contract and apply the complete canonical ArchContext projection as one owned, deterministic update.

## Scope

- Own every file returned by the canonical projection plan for `hook-adapters.md`.
- Bind the accepted change to the repository owner's explicit ship-and-merge direction.
- Do not hand-edit generated architecture content.

## Allowed Paths

## Task Breakdown

- [x] Capture the complete 12-file canonical projection set.
- [x] Apply the flow-proof projection through ArchContext.
- [x] Run combined repository verification and close both work packages.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop if the provider proposes a path outside this list.
- Stop if the accepted change no longer matches `verified-flow-proof-changed` for the eleven named capabilities.
