## Agentic Routing
- Selected route: planning
- Routing reason: Captured from repo-harness-plan planning output.
- Source ref: (none)
- Due diligence:
  - P1 map: See captured planning output below.
  - P2 trace: See captured planning output below.
  - P3 decision rationale: See captured planning output below.

## Workflow Inventory
Complete this inventory before implementation. If any line is unknown, keep the plan in Draft and fill it before projection.

- Active plan: `plans/plan-20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.md`
- Sprint contract: `tasks/contracts/20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.contract.md`
- Sprint review: `tasks/reviews/20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.review.md`
- Implementation notes: `tasks/notes/20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.notes.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Current checks: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope authority: `tasks/contracts/20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.contract.md` `allowed_paths`
- Concurrency rule: `.ai/harness/active-plan` selects the active plan for this worktree when present; `.ai/harness/active-worktree` records the owning worktree. If another worktree already owns active work, open or switch to the matching worktree instead of serializing unrelated plans.
- Execution isolation: approved contract-level work projects through `repo-harness run plan-to-todo --plan plans/plan-20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.md` and may start `repo-harness run contract-worktree start --plan plans/plan-20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.md`.

## Approach
### Strategy
Use the captured planning output below as the execution source of truth.

### Trade-offs
| Option | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| Captured plan | Preserves the approved Codex Plan or Waza think decision | Requires the captured text to be concrete enough to execute | Use |

## Detailed Design
### File Changes
| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| See captured planning output | Follow | Implement only the approved scope named below |

### Code Snippets
See captured planning output.

### Data Flow
See captured planning output.

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Captured plan lacks enough detail | Medium | Execution may need clarification | Stop before implementation if the captured output contradicts repo rules or lacks concrete file targets |

## Task Contracts
- Contract file: `tasks/contracts/20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.contract.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.review.md`
- Implementation notes file: `tasks/notes/20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.notes.md`
- Template: `.claude/templates/contract.template.md`
- Verification command: `repo-harness run verify-contract --contract tasks/contracts/20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.contract.md --strict`
- Active plan rule: this captured plan is written to `.ai/harness/active-plan` and the owning worktree is written to `.ai/harness/active-worktree` unless --no-active is used. Do not infer active execution from the latest non-archived plan.

## Handoff

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Session handoff: `.ai/harness/handoff/current.md`

## Promotion Gate

- **Merge/PR unit**: Captured plan `plans/plan-20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.md` is the proposed mergeable execution unit; revise before execute if this is only a checklist step.
- **Rollback surface**: Phase 1: revert only this package's local orchestration-worktree commits (never pushed) or remove the worktree; delete the ephemeral detached subject checkout and REPORT_STAGE_DIR (no git history). Phase 2: revert only the VGBR-R report PR; runtime, tests, and the benchmark runner/manifest remain unchanged.
- **Verification boundary**: One authoritative 3x9 (27-arm) profile benchmark invocation executed exactly once inside a detached clean subject checkout pinned at VGBR_BASELINE_SHA; validate-harness-profile-benchmark.ts --require-authoritative and tests/harness-benchmark-matrix.test.ts both pass before promotion into evals/harness/reports/*.
- **Review/acceptance boundary**: `tasks/reviews/20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.review.md` must record pass against the captured acceptance criteria.
- **High-risk surface**: Risks named in captured planning output; keep the plan Draft if risk ownership is not concrete.
- **Why not checklist row**: verification_boundary

## Evidence Contract

- **State/progress path**: `plans/plan-20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.md` task breakdown, `tasks/todos.md` deferred-goal ledger, `tasks/contracts/20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.contract.md`, `tasks/reviews/20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.review.md`, and `tasks/notes/20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.notes.md`
- **Verification evidence**: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`, `.ai/harness/runs/`, and the commands named in the captured planning output
- **Evaluator rubric**: `tasks/reviews/20260722-0020-vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery.review.md` must record a passing Waza /check style recommendation
- **Stop condition**: all task breakdown items are complete, sprint verification passes, and the review recommends pass
- **Rollback surface**: Phase 1: revert only this package's local orchestration-worktree commits (never pushed) or remove the worktree; delete the ephemeral detached subject checkout and REPORT_STAGE_DIR (no git history). Phase 2: revert only the VGBR-R report PR; runtime, tests, and the benchmark runner/manifest remain unchanged.

## Captured Planning Output

> **Task Profile**: eval-only

## Decision Summary

Recover one precise, current, verifiable authoritative benchmark baseline —
the runner-defined 3x9 (27-arm) matrix — at the exact commit
`VGBR_BASELINE_SHA` = `b32b328208da5b07418c4fd815491bcc3913ff9f` (re-pinned
after the `vgbr-rf` runner fix, PR #113, merged), before EPC begins. This
package executes in two phases under separate authorization.
Phase 1 (this capture) opens the dual-checkout execution surface: orchestration
worktree, contract, detached subject checkout, report staging directory, and
attempt record. Phase 2 (separate authorization) runs the single authoritative
invocation, validates it, and promotes the report. Neither phase predicts or
writes its own merge SHA; the next Program package (EPC-00) fresh-fetches
`origin/main` after this package's report PR merges and pins that exact commit
as `POST_VGBR_SHA`.

## Why

`origin/main` has moved repeatedly since the Hook Runtime Diet close-out
(`HRD_RUNTIME_SHA` = `b5a98c903d3728002d2f663ba7a1b421913e368f`): the
HRD-CLOSEOUT lifecycle merge, the acknowledged parallel BDD2 followthrough
PR #109 (merge `9e9dce6e1f817b766d21436c0b69477f6c67ca20`, touching `src/cli`
and `assets` — both benchmark subject inputs), ship-tooling-fixes PR #110,
and two further harness fixes: PR #111 (`REPO_HARNESS_HELPER_SOURCE_PATH`
env-leak fix) and PR #114 (acceptance-recorder `review_base` resolution fix).
`origin/main` first advanced to `0852e9ab72f19b3794d5b8f9463a172e498686c7`;
this package's first attempt (`vgbr-dbcfbe75-20260721-a01`, base `dbcfbe75`,
2026-07-21 21:41-22:18, branch `codex/vgbr-post-hrd-baseline-recovery`)
completed 27/27 producer arms and a passing validator/matrix test, but the
runner's own local-source install step mutated the frozen subject mid-run
(file modes `0755` -> `0777` on `src/cli/index.ts`, `src/cli/hook-entry.ts`).
That attempt correctly self-classified `invalid_report`, copied no canonical
report bytes, and concluded a separately approved runner-fix package plus a
new approved attempt contract were required. Sprint C backlog row 2,
`vgbr-rf`, implemented and merged that fix as PR #113
(`51a2ee7d`, base `61b5ec59`): the runner no longer installs from ROOT (an
external hash-pinned pack artifact plus an isolated `BUN_INSTALL` replace the
mutating install step), with a red-then-green mode-drift regression guard.
The voided attempt's branch/worktree were deleted after the sprint's Attempt
ledger captured the conclusions (user decision 2026-07-22); this package
never revives that slug and opens a fresh branch instead.
`origin/main` now stands at `b32b328208da5b07418c4fd815491bcc3913ff9f`,
re-pinned as `VGBR_BASELINE_SHA` after `vgbr-rf` merged. EPC cannot begin
against a stale, ambiguous, or subject-mutated benchmark baseline: the
existing report at `606b02c1...` is historical evidence only and satisfies
nothing against the current subject. Shipping wrong here means EPC-00..09
either inherit a baseline that silently omits the acknowledged parallel
changes, or the Program mislabels the recovered baseline as "pure post-HRD"
when it is not. This package's mandatory annotation is: the recovered
baseline is the **current pre-EPC baseline after HRD and acknowledged
parallel changes (BDD2 PR #109, ship-tooling PR #110, harness fixes
PRs #111/#113/#114)** — it must never be described as a pure post-HRD
baseline, in this plan, its contract, its notes, or the eventual report.

## Goal

Phase 1 (this capture, executed now):

1. Author this work-package plan and its task contract carrying the full
   Program Rule R6 field set, projected from the sprint's Row 2 VGBR-R
   protocol.
2. Open the orchestration worktree `codex/vgbr-r2-baseline-recovery`
   from the pinned `VGBR_BASELINE_SHA`, owning plan/contract/review/notes,
   the Program dependency annotation, the attempt record, and (later, Phase 2
   only) the three canonical report artifacts.
3. Create a detached, read-only subject checkout at exactly
   `VGBR_BASELINE_SHA`, outside both the root checkout and the orchestration
   worktree. `EXPECTED_SUBJECT_HASH` is left `null` in this phase; Phase 2's
   own preflight computes it — a reproducible content hash over exactly the
   benchmark subject inputs — from that checkout immediately before
   invocation.
4. Create an empty `REPORT_STAGE_DIR` outside the subject checkout.
5. Write one attempt record before any invocation, with `outcome` null.
6. Pass contract preflight and the strict task-workflow gate.
7. Commit plan/contract/notes/attempt-record locally in the orchestration
   worktree. No push, no PR, no benchmark invocation in this phase.

Phase 2 (separate authorization, not executed by this capture):

1. Run the exactly-once authoritative invocation in the detached subject
   checkout.
2. Validate the report and the matrix test in the same checkout.
3. Copy validated artifacts into the orchestration worktree's canonical
   report paths and re-check byte binding there.
4. Record the attempt outcome, finish the contract worktree, open and merge
   the report PR carrying the mandatory pre-EPC-after-HRD-and-BDD2 annotation.

## P1: Architecture Map

- Effective State, Loop Semantics, and Hook Runtime Diet are frozen
  predecessor authorities; this package does not touch their surfaces.
- This package owns exactly one Program slice: authoritative baseline
  recovery. EPC-00..09 and SSD remain no-touch and unblocked by this
  package's existence, but `main` is frozen for benchmark-subject-touching
  PRs from the moment `VGBR_BASELINE_SHA` is pinned until the report PR
  merges (R3).
- Parallel programs (BDD2 or any other) may continue development in their
  own worktrees during the freeze but must not merge into `main` until this
  package's report PR lands.
- The runner, its manifest (`evals/harness/scenarios.json`), its fixture seed
  (`evals/fixtures/harness-matrix`), and the validator are frozen inputs for
  this package; none of them may be edited here.

## P2: Concrete Trace

`origin/main@dbcfbe75` (first VGBR-R attempt base) --> subject mutated
mid-run by the runner's install step --> attempt self-classified
`invalid_report`, consumed, never rerun --> `vgbr-rf` (PR #113) fixes the
runner (external hash-pinned pack artifact, isolated `BUN_INSTALL`, no ROOT
install) --> `origin/main` advances through PR #110/#111/#113/#114 to
`b32b3282` --> fresh fetch verifies `origin/main@b32b3282` equals local
`main` HEAD --> this package re-pins it as `VGBR_BASELINE_SHA` and
`EXPECTED_BASE_SHA` --> a disposable control clone is fast-forwarded to that
exact commit --> the orchestration worktree `codex/vgbr-r2-baseline-recovery`
(fresh branch name; the voided attempt's slug is never revived) branches from
the control clone's `origin/main` --> a detached subject checkout at the same
commit is created outside both checkouts --> the attempt record freezes
`ATTEMPT_ID`, `EXPECTED_SUBJECT_SHA`, `command_sha256`, `provider`,
`provider_cli_version`, `outcome: null`, with `EXPECTED_SUBJECT_HASH` left
`null` in Phase 1 --> contract preflight and the strict workflow gate pass
--> Phase 1 commits land locally --> (separate authorization) Phase 2's own
preflight computes `EXPECTED_SUBJECT_HASH` from the detached checkout
immediately before invocation, then runs the exactly-once invocation -->
validator and matrix test pass --> artifacts promote into the orchestration
worktree's canonical report paths --> the report PR merges into `main`
carrying the mandatory annotation --> EPC-00 fresh-fetches `origin/main` and
pins `POST_VGBR_SHA`.

## P3: Design Decision

- Dual-checkout structure is mandatory (sprint Row 3): a single worktree
  cannot simultaneously hold uncommitted plan/contract files and present a
  clean checkout at the pinned SHA for the benchmark subject.
- The orchestration worktree is opened from a disposable control clone
  (`git clone --local` from the root checkout, origin repointed to the real
  remote, fast-forwarded to `origin/main`), never from the root checkout
  directly, matching the pattern already used by `vgbr-rf` and the prior
  (voided) VGBR-R attempt.
- `EXPECTED_SUBJECT_HASH` is left `null` in this package's Phase 1 attempt
  record. Phase 2's own preflight computes it as a git-blob-identity hash
  over exactly the benchmark subject inputs (`package.json`, `src/cli`,
  `assets`, `scripts/run-harness-profile-benchmark.ts`,
  `scripts/validate-harness-profile-benchmark.ts`,
  `evals/harness/scenarios.json`, `evals/fixtures/harness-matrix`) via
  `git ls-tree -r <sha> -- <paths> | sort | shasum -a 256` from the detached
  checkout, independent of and in addition to the runner's own internal
  evidence hashes (`runner_sha256`/`scenario_manifest_sha256`/
  `fixture_set_sha256`/`install_profile_inputs_sha256`), immediately before
  invocation.
- No compatibility, alias, dual authority, or steady-state shim: this
  package neither retires nor replaces anything; it only recovers evidence.
- The profile-base naming is fixed by the current runner
  (`no-harness` / `adaptive-lite` / `strict-harness`, `adaptive-lite`
  deploying the standard profile); this package restores that runner-defined
  baseline and does not redesign it. A four-arm Lite/Standard/Strict redesign
  is explicitly out of scope and would be a separate approved package.

## Scope

In scope:

- This package's own plan, contract, review, and notes files.
- The orchestration worktree's attempt record under
  `.ai/harness/runs/vgbr-r/`.
- (Phase 2 only) the three canonical report artifacts
  `evals/harness/reports/profile-comparison.{json,md,sha256.json}` and the
  Program dependency annotation recording the recovered baseline.

Out of scope:

- `scripts/run-harness-profile-benchmark.ts`,
  `scripts/validate-harness-profile-benchmark.ts`, the benchmark manifest,
  fixtures, and matrix test — frozen inputs, read-only.
- Any production `src/` path, any LSC/HRD/SSD artifact, any BDD2 artifact.
- Running the benchmark itself, or any `--profile`/`--scenario`/
  `--regrade-existing` flag, in Phase 1.
- A four-arm Lite/Standard/Strict benchmark redesign.
- Re-litigating the original VGBR ordering gap beyond the one annotation
  this package's Program dependency edit records.
- Push, PR open, or merge — Phase 1 ends with local commits only.

## Falsifier

The direction is wrong if recovering the baseline requires editing the
runner, manifest, fixtures, validator, or any production `src/` path, or if
the recovered baseline could be described as a pure post-HRD baseline without
the acknowledged BDD2 parallel-change annotation. Cheapest proof: diff the
detached subject checkout against `VGBR_BASELINE_SHA` after Phase 1 setup and
confirm it is byte-identical and untouched (`git status --porcelain` empty,
`git rev-parse HEAD` unchanged), and confirm the Program annotation text
contains the exact phrase "current pre-EPC baseline after HRD and
acknowledged parallel changes (BDD2 PR #109)" and never the phrase "pure
post-HRD".

## Cheapest Sufficient Proof

- `origin/main` fresh fetch equals local `main` HEAD equals
  `VGBR_BASELINE_SHA` at start.
- Orchestration worktree branch is exactly
  `codex/vgbr-r2-baseline-recovery`, base commit exactly
  `VGBR_BASELINE_SHA`.
- Detached subject checkout: `git status --porcelain` empty, `git rev-parse
  HEAD` equals `VGBR_BASELINE_SHA`, no writes performed inside it.
- `REPORT_STAGE_DIR` exists and is empty.
- Attempt record exists with `outcome: null` and all seven Row-3 fields
  present (`ATTEMPT_ID`, `EXPECTED_SUBJECT_SHA`, `EXPECTED_SUBJECT_HASH`,
  `started_at: null`, `command_sha256`, `provider`, `provider_cli_version`);
  `EXPECTED_SUBJECT_HASH` is `null` by design in Phase 1 (Phase 2 preflight
  computes it), every other field concrete.
- Contract preflight (`contract-run preflight --json`) and
  `check-task-workflow --strict` both pass.
- Every changed path in the Phase 1 commit is inside this contract's
  `allowed_paths`.

## Concurrency and Ownership

- This package owns exactly the paths listed in its contract's
  `allowed_paths`; it does not touch any other package's plan, contract,
  review, notes, or code surface.
- From the moment `VGBR_BASELINE_SHA` is pinned until this package's report
  PR merges, `main` is frozen for any PR touching the benchmark subject
  inputs (sprint R2/R3). Parallel programs may continue in their own
  worktrees but must not merge inside this window.
- If an out-of-band merge lands on `main` touching the benchmark subject
  during the freeze, the attempt is void: stop, re-audit, re-pin — never
  rebase silently and never reuse the stale attempt record.
- Stop if either the orchestration worktree or the detached subject checkout
  requires a file owned by another active package.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if a required edit falls outside this
  contract's exact `allowed_paths`.
- Stop if `origin/main` has moved since the pinned `VGBR_BASELINE_SHA` before
  the orchestration worktree or subject checkout are created — re-fetch and
  re-audit, never silently rebase.
- Stop if the canonical tooling (`capture-plan`, `plan-to-todo`,
  `contract-worktree`) refuses or requires input this package cannot supply;
  report the exact error instead of hand-building a bypass.
- Stop if any Phase-1 step would require running the benchmark runner or
  validator, or passing `--profile`/`--scenario`/`--regrade-existing`.
- Stop after three fail-fix-reverify rounds for one preflight issue.

## Rollback

Phase 1 produces only local, unpushed commits in the orchestration worktree
plus two ephemeral sibling directories (the detached subject checkout and the
report staging directory) that carry no git history of their own. Rollback:
delete the orchestration worktree's local commits (`git reset` inside that
worktree only, never the root checkout) or discard the worktree entirely with
`git worktree remove`; remove the detached subject checkout with `git
worktree remove --force` (safe: it is read-only and clean by construction);
delete the empty `REPORT_STAGE_DIR`. The root checkout is untouched throughout
Phase 1 and requires no rollback action.

## Approved Execution Checklist

- [x] Fresh-fetch `origin/main` and verify it equals `VGBR_BASELINE_SHA`
      (`b32b328208da5b07418c4fd815491bcc3913ff9f`, re-pinned after `vgbr-rf`
      merged); stop and report if not.
- [x] Capture this work-package plan (`Artifact Level: work-package`,
      `Promotion Reason: verification_boundary`); update it in place for the
      re-pinned SHA, fresh branch name, and `vgbr-rf` resolution when a
      resumed attempt supersedes the first fetch.
- [x] Open the orchestration worktree on the fresh branch
      `codex/vgbr-r2-baseline-recovery` (never the voided attempt's slug)
      from the pinned SHA via a disposable control clone
      (`git clone --local` + repoint origin + fetch + fast-forward,
      `git worktree add` from that clone's `origin/main`) rather than the
      root checkout directly.
- [x] Create the detached subject checkout at exactly `VGBR_BASELINE_SHA`
      outside both checkouts; verify clean and pinned. `EXPECTED_SUBJECT_HASH`
      computed pre-invocation and reconfirmed identical post-invocation
      (no drift).
- [x] Create the empty `REPORT_STAGE_DIR` outside the subject checkout.
- [x] Author the task contract in the orchestration worktree with the full
      Program Rule R6 field set, embedding the frozen machine acceptance
      rubric verbatim.
- [x] Write the attempt record (`outcome: accepted`, `started_at`/
      `completed_at`/`EXPECTED_SUBJECT_HASH` all populated) in the
      orchestration worktree's run-evidence location.
- [x] Run contract preflight and `check-task-workflow --strict`; both passed
      clean on first run.
- [x] Commit plan/contract/notes/attempt-record locally in the orchestration
      worktree; not pushed.
- [x] (Phase 2, separately authorized) Run the exactly-once authoritative
      invocation in the detached subject checkout (exit 0, 27/27 arms),
      validate it (stage and canonical, both pass, byte binding held),
      promote the artifacts to `evals/harness/reports/`, and record the
      outcome (`accepted`). Opening the report PR carrying the mandatory
      annotation is explicitly reserved for the orchestrator (no push, PR,
      or receipt by this run) and remains the one outstanding action.

## Annotations
<!-- [NOTE]: prefixed inline. Claude processes all and revises. -->

[NOTE] 2026-07-22 resume: the first fresh-fetch (`0852e9ab...`) was pinned
before `vgbr-rf` (PR #113) merged and was never consumed by an invocation.
Sprint C's Attempt ledger records the actual first invocation attempt
(`vgbr-dbcfbe75-20260721-a01`, base `dbcfbe75`, self-classified
`invalid_report` on runner-induced subject mode drift) and its resolution via
`vgbr-rf`. This resume re-fetches `origin/main`, re-pins `VGBR_BASELINE_SHA`
to `b32b328208da5b07418c4fd815491bcc3913ff9f` (post `vgbr-rf`/#111/#114), and
opens a fresh branch `codex/vgbr-r2-baseline-recovery` via a disposable
control clone rather than reviving the voided attempt's slug or working
directly in the root checkout. This plan's body is updated in place for the
new SHA/branch/annotation rather than re-captured, since it is already the
tracked backlog-row-3 plan artifact on `origin/main`.

## Task Breakdown
- [x] Fresh-fetch `origin/main` and verify it equals `VGBR_BASELINE_SHA` (`b32b328208da5b07418c4fd815491bcc3913ff9f`, re-pinned after `vgbr-rf` merged); stop and report if not.
- [x] Capture this work-package plan (`Artifact Level: work-package`, `Promotion Reason: verification_boundary`); keep it current across the re-pin.
- [x] Open the orchestration worktree on the fresh branch `codex/vgbr-r2-baseline-recovery` (never the voided attempt's slug) from the pinned SHA via a disposable control clone, not the root checkout.
- [x] Create the detached subject checkout at exactly `VGBR_BASELINE_SHA` outside both checkouts; verify clean and pinned; `EXPECTED_SUBJECT_HASH` computed and reconfirmed identical post-invocation.
- [x] Create the empty `REPORT_STAGE_DIR` outside the subject checkout.
- [x] Author the task contract in the orchestration worktree with the full Program Rule R6 field set, embedding the frozen machine acceptance rubric verbatim.
- [x] Write the attempt record (`outcome: accepted`, `started_at`/`completed_at` populated) in the orchestration worktree's run-evidence location.
- [x] Run contract preflight and `check-task-workflow --strict`; both passed clean.
- [x] Commit plan/contract/notes/attempt-record locally in the orchestration worktree; not pushed.
- [x] Run the exactly-once authoritative invocation (exit 0, 27/27 arms), validate it (stage + canonical), and promote the artifacts to `evals/harness/reports/`.
- [ ] Open the report PR carrying the mandatory pre-EPC-after-HRD-and-BDD2 annotation — reserved for the orchestrator (no push/PR/receipt by this run).
