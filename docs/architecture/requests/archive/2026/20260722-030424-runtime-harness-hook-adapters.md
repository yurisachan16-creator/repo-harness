## Required Follow-up

- Read root `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`.
- If functional block is not `root`, read its local `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`.
- Decide whether this change affects module boundaries, entrypoints, dependency rules, runtime paths, or verification commands.
- For substantial changes, write a snapshot under `docs/architecture/snapshots/`.
- When a visual explains the boundary better than prose, add or update a Mermaid fenced block in the relevant architecture module or snapshot Markdown first; that Markdown is the semantic source for LLM readers.
- When a human-readable rendering is useful, generate a matching `$mermaid` architecture HTML file under `docs/architecture/diagrams/` and link it back to the Markdown semantic source.
- Treat `mermaid` as an external installed skill dependency at `~/.codex/skills/mermaid`; do not copy, vendor, or inline its templates into this repo.
- If this starts or advances durable execution, run `repo-harness run workstream-sync ensure --block "src/cli/hook" --request "docs/architecture/requests/runtime-harness-hook-adapters.md"`.
- After the snapshot or diagram is produced, run `repo-harness run context-contract-sync sync-latest` so the local architecture contract block links to the latest artifacts.
