# External Tooling

Generated repos route external tooling by host/runtime shape. Task-level
skill routing lives in `docs/reference-configs/agentic-development-flow.md`.

- `Waza` supplies `/think`, `/hunt`, and `/check` for daily small/medium work
- `reverse-skill-router` is an explicit-only recommended router for independently authorized reverse-engineering and security work
- `hai-stack` supplies `geju` for live, pre-contract exploration; only its frozen output enters a contract
- Codex automation requires `health`, `check`, and `mermaid` from `~/.codex/skills`
- `CodeGraph` is required agent readiness for code navigation and impact tracing
- repo-harness's packaged `agent_fleet` supplies the delegation loop's global agent definitions (`explorer`, `deep-reasoner`, `fast-worker`, `gatekeeper`, `root-cause-prover`, `harness-evaluator`) for both hosts

Waza is Codex-first in this contract. `~/.codex/skills` is the Codex runtime
source, while `~/.agents/skills` is only the skills CLI staging/cache path used
to receive upstream `tw93/Waza` updates before syncing verified copies into
Codex.

`hai-stack` is Codex-first in this contract too. `~/.codex/skills` is the
Codex runtime source for `geju`, while `~/.agents/skills` is only the skills
CLI staging/cache path used to receive upstream `hylarucoder/hai-stack`
updates before syncing verified copies into Codex. `geju` is pre-contract
exploration only — live judgment that produces a thesis, direction, and
falsifier; once that output is frozen into a task contract's `## Why` and
`## Falsifier` sections, the contract is authoritative and `geju` is not
consulted again for that task.

`repo-harness install` is allowed to bootstrap the workflow-owned global runtime
in one pass: the `repo-harness` CLI, repo-harness runtime aliases, user-level
Codex/Claude hook adapters, Waza (`think`, `hunt`, `check`, `health`), brain
root persistence, Mermaid, and CodeGraph CLI/MCP configuration.
`repo-harness init` remains a compatibility alias for existing automation. The
bootstrap path must not silently install unrelated toolchains or Claude
marketplace plugins.

`repo-harness uninstall` removes repo-harness managed Codex/Claude hook
adapters. It intentionally does not uninstall Waza, Mermaid, Reverse Skill, CodeGraph,
brain config, package-manager globals, or user-authored sibling hook entries.

`repo-harness update` is a reconciliation command, not a best-effort package
install. It verifies the installed package's exact `archctx` and
`archctx-contracts` dependencies, package-local CodeGraph, compatible ArchContext
Node runtime, and capability handshake. A stale Bun global dependency tree is
reported with explicit remove/install recovery commands; update does not remove
a working CLI before a replacement is known-good. The global CodeGraph CLI/MCP
is refreshed at the exact shipped compatibility version. Mutable third-party
Waza and Mermaid providers remain behind explicit `--with-external-skills`;
`--no-codegraph` disables the CodeGraph refresh.
Repo-local workflow refresh stays on `repo-harness init`; `setup check
--check-updates` remains the read-only advisory surface.

The cross-review skill is **harness-owned and self-contained** — its source
lives in `assets/skills/repo-harness-cross-review/` and it wraps the peer CLI
(`codex exec` / `claude -p`) in a read-only sandbox with no external
planning-provider runtime, so installing it is a workflow-owned runtime
concern, not an unrelated toolchain. `repo-harness-cross-review` installs
host-aware during `repo-harness install`/`init` and explicit external-skill
refreshes: it installs into **both** `~/.claude/skills` (a Claude session
asking Codex for an independent review, via its Codex provider mode) and
`~/.codex/skills` (a Codex session asking Claude for a review, via its Claude
provider mode) for the full profile. `claude-plan` installs only into
`~/.codex/skills` (a Codex session using Claude's headless plan mode for a
plan consult on a mid-execution design fork) and is unaffected by this
package's host-aware installation. These harness skills ship with the full
profile (the default for `init`) and provide the peer acceptance gate surface
for the typed `AcceptanceReceipt`; the review section is projection only.

Reverse Skill is registered from `zhaoxuya520/reverse-skill` as the recommended
but explicit-only `reverse-skill-router`. It is not part of either install
profile because the upstream pack requires agents to read
`field-journal/precedent-auth.md`, which treats merely mentioning a target as
authorization. That assumption cannot replace a real scope or RoE boundary.
The catalog pins upstream commit
`539899ddc7608d63dc66e08e794d572e080f1a55` and the selected tree digest
`sha256:7aafee6c0dec684d410af6864ab77da4d88b9d442142c0efb91b235ce9793dda`;
repo-harness verifies the full staged tree before projecting it into either
host root.
After independent review, install it explicitly:

```bash
repo-harness install --with-reverse-skill
repo-harness update --with-reverse-skill
```

Add `--no-external-skills` to the install command when Reverse Skill should be
the only marketplace Skill added. The Skills CLI copies the router pack into
the selected host Skill roots; repo-harness does not execute its workflows or
bootstrap its optional analysis/security toolchains during install.

The review scope is the current reviewable diff, not just committed branch
history: branch diff against the default base, staged changes, unstaged tracked
changes, and untracked files are all in scope. A timeout or missing peer CLI is
reported as unavailable review evidence, not as a pass.

The Codex automation profile is a runtime reference, not a vendored copy. It
requires Waza `health`, Waza `check`, and the standalone `mermaid` skill to
exist under `~/.codex/skills`; the skill bodies stay owned by their original
installations.

The official Obsidian skills are runtime-referenced too, not vendored. The
repo-owned `obsidian-memory` facade (source in `assets/skills/obsidian-memory/`,
projected into both host skill roots) owns only the judgment layer — what to
recall, what is worth persisting, and how the project sub-vault is organized —
and delegates every Obsidian-specific format and runtime action to the official
skills: `obsidian-markdown` for authoring or rewriting vault notes, and
`obsidian-cli` for searching, opening, or operating on a running vault. Both
must exist under `~/.claude/skills` and `~/.codex/skills`;
`bash scripts/check-agent-tooling.sh --host both` probes both roots and reports
a missing skill as a gap in the `obsidian_runtime_skills` section. The gap is
advisory for the environment check and fail-closed at skill runtime:
`obsidian-memory` stops and reports rather than hand-writing its own Markdown
dialect. This repo does not vendor either skill body.

## Detect Safely

Use `repo-harness run check-agent-tooling` for a read-only tooling report.
Init and migration reports run the detector without update checks by default;
set `REPO_HARNESS_CHECK_TOOLING_UPDATES=1` when that advisory pass should
also compare upstream versions.

Supported flags:

- `--host claude|codex|both`
- `--json`
- `--check-updates`
- `--strict-readiness`

The detector intentionally avoids side-effecting commands. It does not run:

- `npx skills check`
- `npx skills update`
- `codegraph init`
- `codegraph sync`
- `codegraph install`

With `--check-updates`, Waza update checks fetch upstream GitHub raw
`SKILL.md` and shared `rules/` files, then compare versions/hashes against each
host path. The detector also compares each host's Waza skill directories and
shared rules against the `~/.agents` staging cache so helper files under
`references/`, `scripts/`, `agents/`, and cross-skill `rules/` links cannot
silently drift. Network failures are reported as `unknown`; the detector never
updates skills.

## Install

### Waza

Both hosts:

```bash
bunx skills add tw93/Waza -g -a claude-code codex -s think hunt check health -y
```

Single host:

```bash
bunx skills add tw93/Waza -g -a claude-code -s think hunt check health -y
```

Replace `claude-code` with `codex` when installing for Codex only.

After installing or updating through the skills CLI, verify Codex has its own
runtime copy:

```bash
for d in think hunt check health; do
  rsync -a --delete ~/.agents/skills/$d/ ~/.codex/skills/$d/
done
mkdir -p ~/.codex/rules
for f in anti-patterns.md chinese.md durable-context.md english.md; do
  cp ~/.agents/rules/$f ~/.codex/rules/$f
done
for d in think hunt check health; do
  diff -qr ~/.agents/skills/$d ~/.codex/skills/$d
done
for f in anti-patterns.md chinese.md durable-context.md english.md; do
  cmp -s ~/.agents/rules/$f ~/.codex/rules/$f
done
```

### hai-stack

Both hosts:

```bash
bunx skills add hylarucoder/hai-stack -g -a claude-code codex -s geju -y
```

Single host:

```bash
bunx skills add hylarucoder/hai-stack -g -a claude-code -s geju -y
```

Replace `claude-code` with `codex` when installing for Codex only.

After installing or updating through the skills CLI, verify Codex has its own
runtime copy:

```bash
rsync -a --delete ~/.agents/skills/geju/ ~/.codex/skills/geju/
diff -qr ~/.agents/skills/geju ~/.codex/skills/geju
```

### CodeGraph

`CodeGraph` is required readiness for agent code navigation. It speeds up
Codex and Claude exploration for indexed TypeScript and other supported languages, but it
does not replace `.ai/context/capabilities.json`, workflow checks, tests,
architecture drift events, or shell-script review.

This self-host repo vendors CodeGraph as a dev dependency so `bun install`
materializes `node_modules/.bin/codegraph`; its source-only
`scripts/ensure-codegraph.sh` can manage the local index. Generated downstream
repos keep the global MCP installer default and should use the `codegraph`
command directly unless local policy explicitly opts into vendoring.

### Runtime Ownership Boundary

`repo-harness setup check --target <host> --check-updates --json` reports the
execution base as separate `runtime.*` checks and reports repo-local adoption
refresh as `repo.init-refresh` when the current repo has opted in. Keep the
boundary explicit:

| Capability | Owner | Required for |
|---|---|---|
| `bun` | repo-harness | repo-harness-owned global installs, local dependency install, tests, and runtime execution |
| `bash` | repo-harness | helper scripts, migration, setup checks, and contract verification wrappers |
| `npm` | npm registry | registry readbacks, publish gates, and opt-in update checks; not repo-harness-owned global install repair |
| `npx` / `skills_cli` | external Skills CLI | Waza and Mermaid skill bootstrap/update commands |
| `rsync` | platform filesystem | Waza staging-to-Codex sync and installed-copy runtime mirroring |
| `symlink` | platform filesystem | link-mode aliases; copy mode is the fallback |

The policy is Bun-first, not Bun-only. Repo-harness-owned install/repair commands
use `bun add -g` or `bun install`. Waza/Mermaid remain explicit external Skills
CLI dependencies until a separate plan replaces that integration. Missing
optional capabilities should degrade the named feature, not blur command
ownership.

Installed-copy sync has two explicit modes. `AGENTIC_DEV_LINK_INSTALLED_COPIES=1`
uses symlinks and does not require `rsync`; if symlink creation fails, the
script reports unsupported link-mode and tells the caller to use copy-mode.
`AGENTIC_DEV_LINK_INSTALLED_COPIES=0` uses copy-mode and requires `rsync`; if
`rsync` is missing, the script reports unsupported copy-mode instead of a
generic command failure.

Read-only check:

```bash
codegraph status .
```

Local index mutation:

```bash
codegraph init -i .
codegraph sync .
```

Do not ask users to copy MCP TOML or Claude JSON by hand. The user-facing path
is one terminal command, or explicit authorization for their agent to run the
same command:

```bash
bun add -g @colbymchenry/codegraph && repo-harness tools configure codegraph --target codex --location global
```

This delegates host-specific MCP config to CodeGraph's target adapters for
Codex and Claude, so do not run CodeGraph setup automatically from
`repo-harness init`, `migrate`, or `upgrade`. Restart Codex after the installer
finishes so the MCP server is discovered; Claude Code should pick up its config
according to its own settings reload behavior. If a launch environment still
cannot find `codegraph`, an authorized agent should diagnose `PATH` and the
`~/.local/bin/codegraph` shim. Do not make the user hand-edit MCP config as the
fallback.

For troubleshooting only, inspect host config snippets without writing:

```bash
codegraph install --print-config codex
codegraph install --print-config claude
```

Project-local indexes are ignored runtime state:

```bash
codegraph init -i .
codegraph status .
```

Before non-trivial code work, agents should sync the local index and use it for
P1/P2 discovery:

```bash
codegraph sync .
codegraph context "<task>"
codegraph query <symbol> --json
codegraph callers <symbol> --json
codegraph callees <symbol> --json
codegraph impact <symbol> --json
```

For this repo, do not treat `codegraph affected` as an authoritative test
selector. Many tests execute scripts by path or subprocess rather than import
edges, so run the repo verification commands instead.

### Bash Output Evidence and RTK

`repo-harness` treats Bash output as runtime evidence, not durable task state.
`PostToolUse:Bash` records command metadata in `.ai/harness/checks/` and stores
large or failed command output under ignored `.ai/harness/runs/bash-output/` with
the byte count, SHA-256 digest, and relative evidence path.

RTK can be useful as a user-level compression tool for noisy successful shell
commands, but it is optional and advisory-only. Hooks may suggest `rtk` when it
is already on `PATH`, the command is broad, and the command succeeded; hooks must
not rewrite Bash commands, require RTK, or suggest compression for failed
commands. Failed command output stays raw so test, build, and review evidence is
not hidden by a compressor.

## External Verification Evidence

Runtime-heavy projects often prove work outside normal source files and unit
test output. Unity, browser E2E, mobile simulators, hardware rigs, and staging
smoke tests can all produce logs, screenshots, traces, or device output that
belongs in the harness review flow without making `repo-harness` run those
tools directly.

Today this is a convention only: `repo-harness` does not automatically discover,
summarize, or gate on these manifests yet.

For the CLI/npm release surface, `runtime-evidence-receipt.ts verify` is the
bounded exception: it records a separate `RuntimeEvidenceReceipt v1` only when
a registry readback binds the published tarball and a clean install returns the
expected CLI version and `repo-harness-state-snapshot` hook contract. The
installed package manifest must declare `repo-harness` and `repo-harness-hook`
bin targets; supplied executable paths resolve to those in-package targets
(including `.bin` symlinks), and the installed manifest plus both bin contents
must byte-match their published tarball members. This is
release-side runtime evidence, not an `AcceptanceReceipt`, task-review oracle,
scheduler, or service-auth readback; missing any observation fails closed.
Installed CLI/hook commands run with the current trusted Bun executable
directory plus `/usr/bin:/bin`, which is the minimum PATH supporting their real
`#!/usr/bin/env bun` shebang without inheriting the caller environment.

The recommended v1 convention is evidence ingestion, not provider invocation.
It is not yet an automatic `repo-harness check` gate:

- external validators run under the project's own tooling and trust boundary
- providers publish a small manifest plus artifact references
- reviewers can cite these manifests from check/review/handoff artifacts
- automatic manifest discovery and summarization are follow-up implementation
  work
- missing, skipped, or partial external evidence should be recorded as
  validation gaps, not treated as implicit passes

Recommended runtime layout:

```text
.ai/harness/runs/external/<task-id>/<run-id>/manifest.json
.ai/harness/runs/external/<task-id>/<run-id>/artifacts/...
```

This uses the existing ignored run-evidence surface. Durable conclusions should
be promoted into `tasks/reviews/<task>.review.md`, `tasks/contracts/`,
`tasks/notes/`, or project documentation instead of committing raw provider
artifacts by default.

Minimal manifest shape:

```

Manifest locations are repo-relative when cited from durable reviews. Artifact
paths inside a manifest are relative to the manifest directory unless explicitly
documented otherwise. Providers should prefer summaries over absolute local
paths, mark whether artifacts are redacted, avoid storing secrets or private
payloads in durable summaries, and record skipped validation explicitly so
reviewers can see what was not exercised.

Use `read_only` only when the provider did not mutate project files, runtime
caches, devices, external services, or build outputs.

Global agent skills that wrap external validators should be project-gated:
activate only when the current repo has an explicit local marker or CLI, no-op
outside that repo, and keep the repo's own AGENTS/CLAUDE/repo-harness routing in
control. Treat this as activation and DX isolation, not a complete security
boundary for untrusted repositories.

## Agent Fleet

`agent_fleet` is a repo-harness-owned package surface declared in
`.ai/harness/policy.json` under `external_tooling.agent_fleet` and detected by
`check-agent-tooling.sh`. The single authored source is
`package:agents/fleet`; it ships inside the npm package and never requires a
network fetch. The managed list is `explorer`, `deep-reasoner`, `fast-worker`,
`deep-worker`, `gatekeeper`, `root-cause-prover`, and `harness-evaluator`.

### Two targets, one source

- Claude Code: `~/.claude/agents/<agent>.md` — the packaged source `.md` file
  is installed byte-for-byte.
- Codex: `~/.codex/agents/<agent>.toml` — generated deterministically from the
  same packaged `.md`; there is no second authored copy for Codex.

### `.md` -> `.toml` mapping

The generator is fail-closed: it asserts `name`, `description`, `model`, and
`effort` are present in the packaged frontmatter, and only recognizes the
family/effort pairs below. Any other combination is an error, not a guessed
mapping.

| Source `model` | Codex `model` | Source `effort` | Codex `model_reasoning_effort` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `opus` | `gpt-5.6-terra` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` | same string, unchanged |
| `sonnet`, `haiku` | `gpt-5.6-luna` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` | same string, unchanged |
| `fable` | `gpt-5.6-sol` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` | same string, unchanged |

Three per-agent target overrides are applied after tuple validation, on top of
the family row above, and are the only effort remaps in the generator:
`fast-worker` (`opus`/`medium`) targets `gpt-5.6-luna` at `max` reasoning
instead of the opus family's `gpt-5.6-terra`/`medium`; `deep-worker`
(`opus`/`high`) and `gatekeeper` (`opus`/`high`) keep the opus family's
`gpt-5.6-terra` model but bump reasoning to `xhigh` instead of `high`. Every
other agent's Codex model and effort follow the family row unchanged.

`fast-worker`, `deep-worker`, `root-cause-prover`, and `harness-evaluator`
receive `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"`; every other role receives
`sandbox_mode = "read-only"`. Current assignments are explorer
(`sonnet/high`), deep-reasoner (`opus/xhigh`), fast-worker (`opus/medium`),
deep-worker (`opus/high`), gatekeeper (`opus/high`), root-cause-prover
(`opus/high`), and harness-evaluator (`opus/high`). Root-cause-prover's prompt further limits
writes to bugfix evidence inside the active contract's allowed paths;
harness-evaluator runs existing skill/adoption surfaces only when both repo and
HOME pass the runner's disposable boundary: skills uses `--require-disposable`,
while adoption uses one `--run-adoption-profile` invocation that injects the
validated repo/HOME into inspector and init dry-run. Guarded skills overrides
the ordinary sibling workspace default with a repo-internal workspace, and both
profiles scrub inherited repo-harness source/helper overrides. The guard rejects source
checkout and real HOME in either argument position; the role returns BLOCKED
when the guard fails and must not access the independent `evals/bdd2/**` authority. The opus
family projects to Terra by default with effort carried through unchanged; the only effort
remaps are the three explicit per-agent overrides above, and any unmapped model/effort
combination remains a hard error.

The Codex generator also rewrites the exact upstream provider label in the
description (for example, `Opus at max effort` or `Sonnet at high effort`) to the
mapped GPT-5.6 model and reasoning level. A missing label fails closed so the
installed metadata cannot claim a different model from the TOML settings.

These files define the desired installed role configuration for Codex native
MultiAgent `agent_type` selection. On Codex CLI 0.147, the supported repository
fleet roots use the live v2 native spawn surface. `agent_type` is the only fleet
identity/lifecycle authority, and a repository fleet dispatch packet must also
pass `fork_turns="none"` and remain self-contained. If the live schema cannot
accept the requested installed `agent_type` and v2 packet shape, the fleet
dispatch fails closed instead of translating fields or selecting an App thread,
`codex-exec`, a generic subagent, or the main thread.

The native multi-agent tool surface is routed per root model by the Codex model
catalog (`models_cache.json#multi_agent_version`, verified on CLI 0.147.0):
`gpt-5.6-sol`/`sol-wm`/`terra` roots get v2 with `task_name`, `fork_turns`,
`list_agents`, and `send_message`; `gpt-5.6-luna` and `codex-auto-review` roots
get the v1 namespace. V1 still discovers configured custom agent TOMLs and
accepts `agent_type`, but uses `fork_context=false`, `send_input`,
`resume_agent`, `close_agent`, and `wait`; its tools may be deferred behind
`tool_search`. A V1 root is outside this repository's v2 fleet packet contract,
so dispatch from that surface fails closed as repository policy, not because
Codex V1 can only create a generic built-in subagent.

`features.multi_agent_v2 = true` is a global override that forces every root
model onto v2. It is not a prerequisite for fleet dispatch from a sol/terra root
and must not be enabled as a "fix" for a dispatch that failed to pass
`agent_type`/`fork_turns`. The v2 `list_agents` tool enumerates live agent
threads in the current task tree, not the installed role registry. Luna's v1
marking has no official rationale (open upstream issue openai/codex#35097) and
is treated as catalog state, not a model-capability claim.

Installed files do not by themselves prove that Codex honored the configured
model. Runtime selection claims stay behind official `SubagentStart`
`agent_type`/`model` evidence. `SubagentStart` does not expose reasoning effort,
so that field remains `configured_unverified` and is never promoted to a runtime
claim.

A 2026-08-11 Codex CLI 0.147 canary recorded `explorer` on its configured
`gpt-5.6-luna` model and `deep-reasoner` on its configured `gpt-5.6-terra`
model in one session. The strict tooling check aggregated both official
observations as `verified`. This closes the older flat-V2 limitation for the
versioned native surface; it does not turn missing future `agent_type` or model
readback into a compatibility fallback.

### Local merge gate

The local merge gate is provider-free. Semantic authority lives only in the
host-owned AcceptanceReceipt created from the reviewer frozen in the task
contract, or from a typed user waiver when that contract allows it.
`merge-gate.ts` verifies the receipt and seals the exact base SHA, head SHA,
full binary diff, receipt bytes, and installed helper bytes. It never owns
provider credentials or starts a reviewer.

The exact target base commit enables the local gate in
`.ai/harness/policy.json#merge_gate`; the candidate cannot disable that base
requirement. Runtime setup installs no merge-gate skill, agent, or provider
runtime. Caller `HOME`, helper-source, and runner environment overrides are ignored for
the protected ship/gate helpers. The official runner also pins Bash, Git, Bun,
and `gh` to installed host executables and replaces caller `PATH` with the
minimal host runtime path. The host state directories, AcceptanceReceipt, and
seal must be owned by the OS account and not group/world writable. After
`contract-worktree finish` creates the candidate commit, the installed helper
binds the seal to repository root, target base ref/SHA, candidate head SHA,
binary diff fingerprint, AcceptanceReceipt fingerprint, and installed helper
fingerprint. `contract-worktree` and
`ship-worktrees` revalidate the exact SHA immediately before merge or push;
PR mode fetches the remote base first and pushes an explicit SHA refspec.

The receipt and seal live outside the candidate workspace at
`~/.repo-harness/gates/<repo-id>/acceptance.latest.json` and
`merge-seal.latest.json`. A missing/rejected/stale receipt, direct
candidate-helper execution, dirty worktree, semantic subject change,
overlapping target movement, moved HEAD, or mismatched seal blocks the side
effect. Non-overlapping target movement recomputes only the local seal.

This is a same-user local control for bounded agents, not a defense against the
machine owner or an unrestricted same-user process. Hosted branch protection
and CI remain the remote merge authority.

For Codex, repo-harness keeps configuration readiness and runtime routing
readiness separate:

- `UserPromptSubmit.delegation` is an explicit command adapter only: `/delegate`
  or `/parallel` injects the bounded dispatch contract. Natural-language prompt
  classification and SessionStart standing authorization are not authorities.
- `SubagentStart.context` consumes Codex's official `agent_type` and `model`
  fields plus `turn_id` and `agent_id`. It enumerates project custom-agent TOML
  files first, then user files, parses them with `Bun.TOML.parse`, selects by
  the schema-authoritative `name`, and writes one atomic observation per child
  under the event-scoped directory referenced by
  `.ai/harness/delegation/native-role-routing.json`, even when no prompt advisor
  state exists. It does not read Codex transcripts. The filename is only a
  convention; an unrelated valid profile may inherit its model, while the selected profile
  must pin one before repo-harness can verify model routing.
- `check-agent-tooling.sh` deterministically aggregates the current native
  event scope only; it never revives a historical scope. The hook retains at
  most 32 observations in that scope and removes older managed scope evidence
  under a dedicated native-evidence lock. Each verified or mismatched
  observation carries the selected TOML SHA-256, so later config drift
  invalidates stale evidence. `--strict-readiness` fails after `unverified`,
  `unavailable`, `mismatch`, `invalid`, structurally malformed evidence, an
  empty current scope, or a missing current pointer target.

The official [Codex Subagents documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/subagents)
documents `model_reasoning_effort` in each agent file, and the official
[Configuration Reference](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference)
also documents `agents.default_subagent_reasoning_effort` plus explicit spawn
effort precedence. `SubagentStart` does not expose the effective
`model_reasoning_effort`, so repo-harness records `reasoning_effort_status =
"configured_unverified"` and never promotes a configured or requested value to
runtime proof. A missing, default,
mismatched, invalid, or unverified native observation blocks a role-routing
claim and authorizes no alternate fleet runner. repo-harness must not scrape
rollout JSONL or SQLite as a compatibility path.

`developer_instructions` is the packaged `.md` body plus the canonical
EXECUTION_BOUNDARY anti-extras clause, kept byte-identical to the
`EXECUTION_BOUNDARY` constant in `scripts/contract-run.ts` so every generated
Codex agent carries the same boundary as the Claude worker prompts, the MCP
`codex-goal` path, and the Codex delegation advisor hook.

### `install_mode`: self-host vs. downstream

`install_mode` has the same self-host/downstream split as `codegraph`'s
`install_mode`:

- This repo's own `.ai/harness/policy.json` sets
  `"install_mode": "auto-install-on-init"` — `init` and `migrate --apply`
  install the fleet automatically.
- Generated downstream repos default to `"install_mode": "advisory"` — `init`
  and `migrate` only print a one-line reminder naming
  `repo-harness run install-agent-fleet`; nothing is written automatically.

`migrate --dry-run` never installs the fleet regardless of `install_mode`;
dry-run makes no writes to the global agent-fleet directories at all.

### Install / update

```bash
repo-harness run install-agent-fleet
```

The installer resolves `agents/fleet` from its authoritative helper source path,
not from the target repository's current working directory. There is no source
override, curl path, remote fallback, or alternate authority. It validates all
six source files before mutating any target; a missing, malformed, mismatched,
or unmapped source makes the whole run fail closed and leaves installed files
untouched.

The installer requires Bun >= 1.1.35, matching repo-harness's package runtime
contract and the first supported `Bun.TOML.parse` behavior for the generated
multiline agent files.
The top-level Unix and Windows bootstrap installers upgrade an older detected
Bun before installing repo-harness, rather than relying on package-engine
metadata that older Bun releases do not enforce.
The shared global runtime setup used by mutating `repo-harness install`, `init`,
and `update` binds every Bun subprocess to the exact executable it probes. It
runs and verifies `bun upgrade` only for Bun self-installer-owned binaries;
older Homebrew, Scoop, npm, or other package-manager-owned binaries fail closed
with an actionable manager upgrade command. This covers direct
`bunx`/`bun add`/`npx` entrypoints without overwriting manager-owned files;
read-only update checks bypass this mutation.
Installed Codex identity checks use `Bun.TOML.parse` rather than text matching,
so quoted keys, tables, and multiline strings retain TOML semantics before any
stale managed target can be deactivated.

The installer is **never-clobber by default**: an existing target file that
differs from the newly resolved content is reported as `drift` and left
untouched. Pass `--force` to overwrite drifted files.

An operator who intentionally owns a customized, complete fleet can acknowledge
the current bytes once:

```bash
repo-harness run install-agent-fleet --accept-user-managed
```

The acknowledgement validates all twelve target files before writing
`~/.repo-harness/agent-fleet-user-managed.json`. Claude files must have
well-formed frontmatter with the target role identity, model, effort, and body;
Codex files must be valid TOML with a pinned model, supported reasoning effort,
and developer instructions. Symlinks, missing files, malformed files, or
role-name mismatches fail closed without changing the receipt.

Only customized files are recorded, by absolute path and SHA-256. Later
installer and full-profile runs report those exact bytes as `user-managed`
and do not claim transaction ownership over them. Any subsequent byte change
invalidates the acknowledgement and returns to `drift` until the operator
reviews and accepts the new content. `--force` restores packaged content and
removes the user-managed receipt. Re-running with no packaged-source changes
reports packaged files as `up-to-date`.

### Readiness

`repo-harness run check-agent-tooling --host both --strict-readiness` reports
`agent_fleet` alongside `codegraph`. With `--check-updates`, it compares each
installed Claude-side `.md` against the packaged source hash without network
access. When a file differs from that source, it consults the
`--accept-user-managed` receipt (`~/.repo-harness/agent-fleet-user-managed.json`):
an entry whose SHA-256 still matches the file's current installed content
reports `user-managed` on its own report line instead of drift, while a
missing or malformed receipt, an absent entry for that path, or a stale hash
still reports `drift`, fail-closed. The per-host rollup is `up-to-date` once
nothing is left in drift. The Codex `.toml` side is a generated artifact and
is checked for presence; installer golden tests prove the deterministic
generation.

### Uninstall

There is no uninstall command. Removing the fleet means deleting the twelve
managed files by hand:

```text
~/.claude/agents/explorer.md
~/.claude/agents/deep-reasoner.md
~/.claude/agents/fast-worker.md
~/.claude/agents/gatekeeper.md
~/.claude/agents/root-cause-prover.md
~/.claude/agents/harness-evaluator.md
~/.codex/agents/explorer.toml
~/.codex/agents/deep-reasoner.toml
~/.codex/agents/fast-worker.toml
~/.codex/agents/gatekeeper.toml
~/.codex/agents/root-cause-prover.toml
~/.codex/agents/harness-evaluator.toml
```

## ArchContext Capability Source

`.ai/harness/policy.json#context.capability_source` selects the single capability
authority for a repo:

| Value | Authority | Read path |
|---|---|---|
| `registry` (default) | `.ai/context/capabilities.json` | JSON capability registry |
| `archcontext` | `.archcontext/model/nodes/*.yaml` | `archcontext.node/v2` capability nodes |

Exactly one source is read. There is no dual-read, no merge, and no fallback in
either direction: under `archcontext` a missing model directory fails instead of
falling back to the JSON registry, and under `registry` a present model
directory is never consulted. Under `archcontext` the JSON registry is not
writable, so `repo-harness run capability-config add` refuses and points at the
node files.

Capability authority does not require the `archctx` CLI: node files are read
directly with Bun's native YAML parser, so selecting `capability_source` never
spawns a daemon or external process. Bun older than 1.3 has no `Bun.YAML`; that
fails closed with upgrade guidance and only when `capability_source` is
`archcontext`.

Architecture projection is a separate authority. When
`architecture.projection_provider=archctx`, repo-harness resolves the exact
version from the consumer dependency tree, executes only that package's declared
`bin.archctx`, performs a JSON capability handshake, and rejects PATH-only,
escaping, or mismatched installations. The advisory
global-tool detector below does not satisfy projection readiness; use
`repo-harness architecture-projection status --json`. The provider remains
disabled by default until the release pin is cut over.

When enabled, PostEdit writes only `change_observed` v2 journal records. Stop
coalesces all eligible records into one durable projection job, excludes
ArchContext-owned `docs/architecture/**` and declared agent-context targets,
and acknowledges the source records only after a typed projection receipt is
durable. Process, timeout, stale-snapshot, invalid-result, and refresh failures
remain pending for three attempts before an explicit dead-letter transition.
Preflight failures are jobs too. Each pending journal slot has a stable source
key while its delivery event id rotates on every coalesced edit; a dead letter
blocks aggregate jobs containing that source key, so later edits cannot reset
its attempt budget. Store transitions and queue/dead-letter read models share
one repository lock. One repository has at most one claimed provider process.
If the Stop owner disappears, its running claim remains quarantined for 150
seconds—longer than the 120-second provider bound—before recovery can start a
new attempt; an abandoned third attempt then transitions directly to dead-letter.
Before a retry is claimed, the job refreshes delivery ids for its existing
stable source keys, so edits incorporated before the new snapshot can be
acknowledged while edits arriving during projection remain pending.
`ArchitectureRefreshSignalV1` is the only major-change refresh authority; the
consumer does not infer impact from path names, diff size, or queue-helper
stdout. A typed refresh-required signal runs the canonical architecture,
context-contract, and capability-context writers even when the legacy queue
helper creates no drift card. SessionStart and
`repo-harness architecture-projection drain --json` expose queue state.
Each successful canonical refresh action is checkpointed by action key before
the next action runs, so a partial failure resumes without replaying completed
writers. Missing or stale CLI authority remains a typed refresh failure; it is
not silently skipped.

Projection delivery failures use the independent
`architecture.projection_failure_gate` (`advisory` by default); the existing
`architecture.freshness_gate` retains its merge/drift meaning. A strict
projection failure can be recovered without deleting runtime evidence via
`repo-harness architecture-projection retry-dead-letter --job-id <job> --json`.
An unreadable policy with no active projection queue remains an advisory
configuration error; it cannot silently promote the default gate to strict.
The runtime snapshot excludes `.ai/harness/**`, so concurrent harness receipts
and traces cannot invalidate a provider snapshot.

Managed host adapters give only `Stop.default` 150 seconds so the configured
120-second provider bound has control-plane margin. Every other managed route
remains at 30 seconds, and installer refresh replaces only repo-harness-owned
entries while preserving sibling user hooks.

Before rolling back to a runtime that only understands journal v1, disable the
projection provider with the current runtime, run
`repo-harness architecture-projection drain --json`, and verify the pending
journal count reported as `sourceJournalPending` is zero. The manual drain owns
the same selective source acknowledgement as Stop. Downgrading with v2
observations still pending is not a supported rollback state.

### `source.include` grammar

Upstream matches an include glob against the whole repo-relative path, so a
wildcard-free literal addresses one file, not a directory subtree. To keep the
two authorities from disagreeing about what a boundary covers, only two shapes
are accepted:

| Include | Capability prefix |
|---|---|
| `src/core/adoption/**` | `src/core/adoption` |
| `AGENTS.md` (wildcard-free, not an existing directory) | `AGENTS.md` |

Everything else fails closed. A wildcard-free literal that names an existing
directory is rejected as ambiguous with guidance to write `<dir>/**`.
`source.exclude` is not supported, because capability prefixes have no exclusion
form. Include order is preserved as prefix order.

### Required node fields

| Capability field | Node source | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `domain` / `name` | `id` segments 2 and 3 | `id` must be exactly `capability.<domain>.<name>`, with no `namespace::` prefix |
| display `name` | `name` | required non-empty node/v2 field; validated but not translated into registry identity |
| `summary` | `summary` | required non-empty node/v2 field; validated but not translated into registry semantics |
| `responsibilities` | `responsibilities` | required non-empty string array; validated but not translated into registry semantics |
| `id` | derived | `<domain>-<name>` |
| `architecture_module` | derived | `docs/architecture/modules/<domain>/<name>.md` |
| `workstream_dir` | derived | `tasks/workstreams/<domain>/<name>` |
| `prefixes` | `source.include` | include grammar above |
| `contract_files` | `extensions.contractFiles.agents` / `.claude` | declared, never derived: root-facing capabilities deliberately do not follow their prefix |
| `lsp_profile` | `extensions.lspProfile` | required |
| `verification_hints` | `extensions.verification` | required array; explicit `[]` is allowed |

Nodes whose `kind` is not `capability`, or whose `status` is not `active`, are
skipped and claim no prefixes. Required node/v2 descriptive fields are validated
even when they are not translated. Optional fields this bridge does not consume —
`source.entrypoints`, `ownership`, `interfaces`,
`criticality`, `riskDomains`, `notes`, `parent` — are ignored rather than
translated into local semantics.

### Fail-closed conditions

Source-selection failures exit `2`:

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| unknown `capability_source` value | error naming the policy key and legal values |
| unreadable `.ai/harness/policy.json` | error naming the policy file |
| missing `.archcontext/model/nodes` under `archcontext` | error; never falls back to the JSON registry |
| subdirectory or non-`.yaml`/`.yml` entry in the model directory | error naming the entry |
| unparseable node YAML | error naming the node file |
| `Bun.YAML` unavailable | error with the Bun upgrade path |

Node-shape failures surface as `ARCHCONTEXT_*` registry diagnostics and make
`capability-resolver validate` exit `1` with no stdout; missing/empty node/v2
`name`, `summary`, or `responsibilities` is a structural error and never yields a
partial registry. Derived registries then go through the same
validation as the JSON registry, so duplicate ids, duplicate prefixes, and
invalid paths keep their existing diagnostic codes.

### Node/v2 export round-trip

`repo-harness run capability-resolver export --format archcontext-nodes-v2`
emits complete `archcontext.node/v2` capability nodes. Existing directory
prefixes become explicit `<dir>/**` selectors, while file prefixes remain exact.
The exported `extensions.contractFiles`, `lspProfile`, and `verification` fields
round-trip through the canonical node/v2 reader without deriving missing
semantics. The retired `archcontext-boundaries-v1` format is rejected.

## Manual Brain Vault Export

Long-lived external knowledge may be exported to a brain file vault only through
an explicit operator command:

```text
brain/<project>/*
```

For this repo, use:

```text
brain/repo-harness/*
```

The legacy repo-harness-skill and project-initializer paths have been fully
removed; no tooling recognizes, syncs, or cleans them up. Do not use them as
sync targets.

Keep runtime contracts, hooks, scripts, checks, evidence, and migration state in
the repo. The default brain stores reusable explanations, runbooks, decisions,
and patterns only.

Repo stubs that point to default brain pages are indexed in
`.ai/harness/brain-manifest.json`. Valuable repo-authored docs can opt into
one-way mirroring by adding a manifest entry with:

```json
{
  "id": "project-decision-log",
  "repo_path": "docs/decisions.md",
  "brain_path": "brain/<project>/decisions/project-decision-log.md",
  "sync": { "direction": "repo-to-brain" }
}
```

Hooks and workflow verification do not read, write, or gate on external vault
state. Operators can run these commands when they intentionally want to inspect
or export registered entries:

```bash
repo-harness run check-brain-manifest
repo-harness run sync-brain-docs --all
repo-harness run sync-brain-docs --check
```
