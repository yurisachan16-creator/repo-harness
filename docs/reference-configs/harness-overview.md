# Harness Overview

This repo uses a shared long-running harness. The durable workflow lives in repo-local artifacts, not in chat memory.

## Adoption Model

Use this file as the first onboarding map after `repo-harness init` installs
or refreshes a repo. The harness gives agents three durable surfaces:

- **Shared standards**: `docs/spec.md`, `docs/reference-configs/`, root
  `AGENTS.md`, and root `CLAUDE.md` explain stable product intent, coding
  rules, and local workflow boundaries.
- **Task contracts**: `plans/`, `tasks/contracts/`, `tasks/reviews/`, and
  the current `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json` pointer turn a request into
  scoped implementation work with evidence-backed completion.
- **Session journal**: `.ai/harness/handoff/`, `tasks/current.md`, and
  `.ai/harness/events.jsonl` let a new agent session resume from repo state
  without treating chat history as authority.

The install is not an app scaffold or an agent gateway. It adds a reviewable
workflow contract around an existing repo, then leaves product code ownership
with the project.

## Roles

- **Planner** updates `docs/spec.md`, researches constraints, and writes or approves `plans/plan-*.md`.
- **Generator** implements only against the active sprint contract and the plan's `## Task Breakdown`, leaving `tasks/todos.md` as a deferred-goal ledger, and records task-local implementation judgments in `tasks/notes/<plan-stem>.notes.md`.
- **Evaluator** runs Waza `/check`, then writes `tasks/reviews/<plan-stem>.review.md` using fresh evidence from `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json` and `.ai/harness/runs/*.json`.

## State Flow

1. `docs/spec.md` captures stable product intent.
2. `plans/plan-*.md` captures a concrete execution approach.
3. `tasks/contracts/<plan-stem>.contract.md` defines done for the active sprint.
4. `tasks/current.md` is a tracked mainline status snapshot derived from workflow artifacts; it is not a live lock, kanban board, or implementation gate.
5. `tasks/todos.md` is the deferred-goal ledger; the plan's `## Task Breakdown` and active contract carry sprint execution.
6. `tasks/notes/<plan-stem>.notes.md` records design decisions, deviations, tradeoffs, open questions, and promotion candidates for this sprint only.
7. `tasks/reviews/<plan-stem>.review.md` records evaluator judgment.
8. `.ai/harness/policy.json` is the machine-readable workflow contract.
9. `information_lifecycle` inside `.ai/harness/policy.json` separates notes, raw evidence, reusable assets, advisory memory, and external knowledge.
10. `agentic_development` inside `.ai/harness/policy.json` keeps product, engineering, and design planning parent-owned with `geju` pre-contract framing, and captures the Waza bug-hunt/review routes.
11. `external_tooling` inside `.ai/harness/policy.json` captures host install/update defaults for Waza, `geju`, and required CodeGraph readiness.
12. `.ai/context/capabilities.json` declares capability prefixes, contract files, architecture modules, and workstream directories.
13. `.ai/context/context-map.json` indexes stable root context and discoverable capability context derived from the registry.
14. `documentation` inside `.ai/harness/policy.json` keeps generated docs minimal and moves optional docs to agent-created, evidence-backed output.
15. `lsp_profiles` inside policy and context-map files select tooling hints per capability.
16. `worktree_strategy` inside policy tells agents when to isolate contract-level work in `codex/<slug>` worktrees, start execution through `repo-harness run contract-worktree start --plan <plan>`, and finish with Waza `/check` plus `repo-harness run contract-worktree finish`.
17. `.ai/harness/handoff/current.md` preserves resumable state across sessions.
18. `.ai/harness/events.jsonl` and `.ai/harness/runs/*.json` retain lightweight execution traces.

## Session Boundaries

- Exploration and planning are allowed before a contract exists.
- Before implementation, the plan and contract should both expose a concrete workflow inventory so the agent does not rediscover or guess active artifacts.
- Implementation should prefer `docs/spec.md`, an approved plan, and an active sprint contract.
- Claiming completion should include contract verification evidence, a run snapshot, implementation notes, and a passing Waza `/check` review artifact.
- Stopping a session should refresh `.ai/harness/handoff/current.md` for easier resume; while pending planning orchestration is open, Stop may block once to force a plan completeness self-review before execution.
- Refresh `tasks/current.md` with `repo-harness run refresh-current-status --write --reason <reason>` only at explicit lifecycle boundaries or as a deliberate maintainer action; ordinary hooks should not dirty tracked files.
- In non-target worktrees, read the target branch snapshot with `git show <target>:tasks/current.md` and verify stale or surprising state against the source artifacts before acting.
- Use `docs/reference-configs/agentic-development-flow.md` for skill routing and `docs/reference-configs/external-tooling.md` for install/update commands.
- Use `docs/reference-configs/global-working-rules.md` as the user-level Claude/Codex rule template; keep repo-local workflow contracts in repo files.
- Externalized reference docs may be indexed by `.ai/harness/brain-manifest.json`. Validation and export through `repo-harness run check-brain-manifest` / `sync-brain-docs` are explicit operator actions and never part of hook or workflow correctness.
- Contract-level execution should run in an isolated `codex/<task-slug>` worktree. Merge back only after the contract is fulfilled, `tasks/reviews/<plan-stem>.review.md` recommends pass, and the target worktree is clean.
- Architecture-sensitive work also runs `repo-harness run check-architecture-sync`: the check keeps the request index derived from `docs/architecture/requests/` and, when policy is strict, blocks finish if the current diff touches a capability with a pending architecture request at or above `architecture.gate_min_severity`.
- Adoption retires legacy hook/runtime assets only inside the canonical
  `FsTransaction`: declared paths require an exact SHA-256 match, while
  mismatches, ambiguous app-owned files, and custom adapter siblings are
  preserved and reported.

## Documentation Profile

- Default profile: `minimal-agentic`.
- Required docs: `docs/spec.md` and `docs/architecture/index.md`.
- Optional docs such as `docs/brief.md`, `docs/tech-stack.md`, `docs/decisions.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/packages.md` are created only when the agent has concrete repo evidence or the user asks.
- Root `specs/` is a legacy scaffold surface; use `docs/spec.md`, `interfaces/`, and tests instead.
- Use `docs/reference-configs/document-generation.md` for the creation rules.

## Information Lifecycle

- Notes: `tasks/notes/<plan-stem>.notes.md` is task-local and auditable. It should not be treated as durable knowledge by default.
- Current status: `tasks/current.md` is a tracked derived snapshot for orientation only. It must be regenerated from source artifacts and must not contain hand-written kanban/checklist state.
- Evidence: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json` is the current gate, while `.ai/harness/runs/*.json` keeps ignored local verification snapshots for the current workflow audit. Task-specific `.ai/harness/checks/*.latest.{json,md}` reports are ignored runtime cache; promote durable conclusions into reviews, contracts, notes, or research.
- Human reading surface: `docs/spec.md`, `docs/architecture/`, and durable `docs/researches/` conclusions are the default entrypoint. Root workflow artifacts should describe active work only; completed plan/contract/review/notes/todo artifacts move to `plans/archive/` or `tasks/archive/`, and `.rgignore` keeps those archives plus runtime evidence out of default `rg` results.
- Closeout order: promote durable truth first, then archive the workflow artifacts. If a fact only lives in a review/contract/checks file, the workflow is not ready to disappear from the active reading surface.
- Memory: `docs/researches/` and `tasks/lessons.md` are advisory. Current repo state and evidence override summaries.
- External knowledge: `brain/<project>/*` is an optional operator-managed export surface for long-form explanations, runbooks, decisions, and patterns. Hooks and workflow checks never read, write, or gate on its state.
- Assets: policies, hooks, scripts, templates, and reference configs only change when a pattern has evidence across tasks or fixtures.

## Trace Evidence

`repo-harness run verify-sprint` writes `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json` and an ignored `.ai/harness/runs/*.json` snapshot using `schema: repo-harness-run-trace.v1`. The trace is local evidence for workflow grading, not a cloud tracing dependency or a committed durable artifact.

Required v1 fields:

- `run_id`, `generated_at`, `status`, `exit_code`, and `source`
- `task_profile`, `active_plan`, `contract`, `review`, `worktree`, and `branch`
- `commands`, `guards`, `handoffs`, `files_changed`, and `allowed_paths_check`
- `external_acceptance`, `failure_class`, and `next_step`

`repo-harness run check-task-workflow --strict` validates the latest trace shape when a non-empty latest checks file exists. `repo-harness run harness-trace-grade --run <trace> --strict` applies the local graders used for workflow regression checks: active plan resolves, contract profile is valid, Human Review Card passes, command evidence exists, and changed files stay inside allowed paths.

## Harness Cost Evidence and SLOs

Harness cost reports separate measured values from unavailable telemetry. A
metric is authoritative only when its named source exposes that value directly;
missing or incomplete event metrics keep `runtime_evidence.available: false`.
Reports must not derive model calls from turns, subagents from tool-name text,
billing tokens from byte counts, or hidden legacy-script I/O from local
heuristics.

The two current evidence owners are:

- `.ai/harness/runs/hook-events.jsonl` is the sole hook runtime telemetry
  authority. `src/cli/hook/runtime.ts` appends exactly one
  `loop-engine-hook-event/v1` record per eligible handled host event. Typed
  dispatch evidence contains one `in_process` handler step, direct
  `child_processes: 0`, and no opaque steps. File/write metrics are only
  authoritative at explicit observer boundaries; consumers inspect
  `complete_metrics` and `incomplete_metrics` instead of treating zero as
  proof of complete filesystem coverage. The telemetry append itself is
  excluded from write amplification metrics and is non-authoritative: append
  failure never changes hook safety.
- `scripts/hook-dispatch-diet-report.ts` combines that event authority with
  static route topology and synthetic subprocess probes. Runtime distributions
  and route coverage include sample count, p50, and p95; missing, malformed,
  mixed-protocol, duplicate, or target-incomplete records fail closed. Synthetic
  probe distributions retain total, p50, p95, p99, and max latency. The
  SessionStart token estimate remains labeled `utf8_bytes_div_4`; it is a
  context-budget indicator, not provider billing usage.
- `scripts/run-skill-evals.ts` for end-to-end benchmark duration, changed-file
  evidence, graders, and provider-structured usage. Claude single-result JSON
  and Codex JSONL are parsed independently. Raw output remains an artifact, and
  absent or malformed usage makes only the usage fields unavailable; it does
  not rewrite agent exit or grader status.

Current SLOs:

- Runtime entry: exactly one per eligible host event.
- Direct runtime-dispatch child processes: at most one per event. This does not
  claim to count internal `git`/`bun` plumbing or OS process syscalls.
- Effective State resolution: exactly one for the measured PreEdit and Stop
  target routes.
- PreEdit event p95: target at most 150 ms, initial hard budget 250 ms.
- PostEdit: zero full recovery-projection writes and at most one journal event
  write.
- Stop: at most one recovery-projection write transaction.
- Synthetic hook phase p95: at most 250 ms per probe.
- Estimated actionable SessionStart context: at most 1,500 tokens using the
  explicitly labeled byte heuristic.
- Inert SessionStart: zero additional context bytes.
- Full, non-dry-run benchmark on a supported structured CLI: token usage should
  have `structured_cli` authority. A CLI that does not expose structured usage
  is reported as unavailable rather than silently passing with zero tokens.

The SessionStart budget is global across the aggregated context payload, not a
per-hook allowance. Duplicate sections are identified from both content and
behavioral metadata (`priority`, `mandatory`, `actionable`, and `reference`).
When the budget is pressured, structured harness-state fields are compacted in
a deterministic priority order while preserving the critical workflow state.
If all mandatory critical state cannot fit, aggregation returns a structured
fail-closed overflow result naming every affected section instead of silently
discarding an earlier mandatory section.

Claude cache reads and cache creation tokens remain separate provider fields;
neither is folded into input tokens. Codex cached input remains its own field,
while cache creation stays `null` because the Codex JSONL contract does not
expose it.

`scripts/run-skill-evals.ts` owns the isolated 3-by-9 matrix: **No Harness**,
**Adaptive Lite**, and **Strict**, each across nine scenarios and three runs.
No Harness uses a disposable host home with repo-harness adapters and managed
Skills absent; the harness profiles install into separate disposable homes.
Every authoritative run binds the report to the tested source commit, requires
structured provider usage, records actual hook invocation count and cumulative
hook wall time from hot-path spans, and grades changed files plus the explicit
workflow-artifact path contract. The checked-in report is
`evals/harness/reports/profile-comparison.{json,md}`; it is replaced only by a
complete authoritative matrix, never by a partial or dry-run result.
The two generated comparison files are verification evidence, so regenerating
them is excluded from implementation review freshness just like checks and run
cache; their own source commit, input hashes, provider authority, graders, and
external acceptance remain the evidence-integrity boundary. `verify-sprint`
also records a separate hash of the actual JSON and Markdown bytes in structured
checks; later report edits stale checks without staling the implementation review.

Provider request/model-call count, native subagent count, and true
time-to-first-edit remain unavailable when the provider CLI does not expose
them as structured fields. Reports retain `null` plus the authority reason
rather than inferring those values from turns, tool names, or timestamps.

## Capability Context

- Do not infer agent context boundaries from physical layout globs such as `apps/*`, `packages/*`, or `services/*`.
- Declare capabilities in `.ai/context/capabilities.json`; each capability owns prefixes, paired contract files, an architecture module, a workstream directory, and local verification hints.
- Add selected capabilities with `repo-harness-setup` (capability mode) or `repo-harness run capability-config add --prefix <path>` when the harness already exists and a full init/migrate/upgrade pass would be too broad.
- Resolve edited paths through `repo-harness run capability-resolver match --path <path>`; longest prefix wins and equal-length ambiguity fails.
- Treat `.ai/context/agent-context-blocks.txt`,
  `REPO_HARNESS_CONTEXT_BLOCKS`, and existing nested `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`
  files as migration inputs only; the capability registry is runtime authority.
- Selected capabilities receive paired `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` files so Claude Code and Codex share the same local contract.
- Use `repo-harness capability-context status|request|sync` to keep paired local context files aligned with the registry. The command writes only the controlled `CAPABILITY CONTEXT` block and preserves hand-authored content plus the separate architecture contract block.
- `.ai/context/capability-source-map.json` is the optional human-edited source-map manifest for capability positioning and source pointers. Missing entries fall back to registry/architecture/workstream metadata; `--auto-fill-positioning` writes deterministic draft entries explicitly, not from hooks.
- `.ai/harness/capability-context/` is ignored runtime queue state. Post-edit hooks may enqueue requests, and `SessionStart` only reminds the current agent to run `repo-harness capability-context sync --pending --apply`.
- `.ai/harness/architecture-projection/` is ignored durable projection runtime state. It owns one running provider job per repository, pending jobs, typed receipts, refresh receipts, and dead letters; source observations are acknowledged only after a terminal receipt. SessionStart exposes the exact oldest dead-letter id for the explicit `architecture-projection retry-dead-letter` recovery command.
- `SessionStart` also summarizes pending architecture request cards so a resumed agent can see drift debt before claiming finish.

## Initializer and Runtime Model

Maintainer-facing detail on how the initializer and runtime defaults are wired.

- Question flow uses **12 grouped decision points** with harness defaults inferred first.
- Plan menu is tiered: **Core Plans (A-F)** first, **Custom Presets (G-K)** only when needed.
- Skill routing is inspection-first: `scripts/inspect-project-state.ts`, `src/core/adoption/standard-plan.ts`, `assets/workflow-contract.v1.json`.
- Runtime mode is configurable with template vars: `{{RUNTIME_MODE}}`, `{{RUNTIME_PROFILE}}`, `{{RECOVERY_PROFILE}}`, `{{STATE_PROFILE}}`.
- Question-pack source of truth: `assets/initializer-question-pack.v4.json`.
- Generated repos default to the repo-local harness flow: `docs/spec.md -> plans/ -> tasks/contracts/ -> tasks/reviews/ -> .ai/context/context-map.json -> .ai/harness/*`.
- Generated and self-hosted repos install `.ai/harness/workflow-contract.json` and `.ai/harness/policy.json`.
- Host events use the user-level managed adapter projection, the 11-tuple
  `route-registry.ts`, and exactly one typed in-process handler per tuple.
  `.ai/hooks/lib/workflow-state.sh` is an operator helper projection, not a
  second host-event runtime.
- Generated and migrated repos keep discovery and complex/design planning in the parent agent: `geju` opens the pre-contract frame, then the parent completes P1/P2/P3 and freezes the accepted direction. Daily small/medium work uses Waza with Codex-first runtime copies in `~/.codex/skills`; durable knowledge stays in repo-authored research and lessons.
- `repo-harness install` bootstraps the package-owned Codex/Claude runtime pieces for the default workflow: refreshes `repo-harness` skill aliases, installs global Codex/Claude hook adapters, persists the brain root in `~/.repo-harness/config.json`, and configures CodeGraph MCP for selected host agents. Mutable Waza and Mermaid providers are installed only after explicit selection. `repo-harness init` remains a compatibility alias for existing automation.
- The recommended `reverse-skill-router` remains explicit-only through `--with-reverse-skill` because its upstream authorization assumption cannot replace independently verified scope; the pinned selected tree is integrity-checked before host projection.
- Read-only external-tooling audit stays advisory: `repo-harness run check-agent-tooling --host both --check-updates`. The explicit mutating boundary is `repo-harness update`, which reconciles mandatory ArchContext packages and runtime and updates the global CodeGraph CLI/MCP; mutable Waza/Mermaid providers require `--with-external-skills`. It does not initialize or sync a repository CodeGraph index.
- Manual distillation stays repo-local: repeated corrections -> `tasks/lessons.md`; deep findings and hidden contracts -> topic-scoped `docs/researches/*.md`; sprint verification evidence -> `tasks/reviews/*.review.md`; durable capability progress -> `tasks/workstreams/`; release history -> `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.

### Package Manager Defaults

- General default priority: `bun > pnpm > npm`.
- **Plan G/H** (Python-centric) default to **`uv`** as the primary package manager.

### Runtime Profiles

The initializer offers exactly three runtime profiles:

- `Plan-only (recommended)` (default)
- `Plan + Permissionless`
- `Standard (ask before each action)`

They are configured in `assets/initializer-question-pack.v4.json` and consumed by
`scripts/initializer-question-pack.ts`.
