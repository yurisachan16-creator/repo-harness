# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill are documented here.

## [0.15.2] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Adds `obsidian-memory` as a repo-owned dual-host skill-surface facade, with
  the official Obsidian skills declared as runtime-referenced tooling in
  `check-agent-tooling` and authority-boundary tests pinning the facade
  contract.

### Changed

- Syncs the archctx dependency line to 0.4.3 with docs-renderer v3 and moves
  the three version anchors, adopting the upstream canonical-body-digest fix
  that stops projection restamp churn.
- Strips machine node-runtime authority from faked PATH environments in the CLI
  tests so local and CI runs agree.

### Fixed

- Resolves archctx from the target repository before the CLI root, closing the
  window where a freshly refreshed global CLI blocked the Stop-gate
  architecture projection drain of an unrelated repo.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- Adds a contract-first Change Assessment and typed AcceptanceReceipt path that
  binds verification, review selection, final subject, and explicit user
  waivers before a work package can close.
- Adds durable hook-effect failure semantics with stop, retry, recovery, and
  event telemetry, plus a Goal Calibration Gate that asks at most one
  highest-information-gain planning question.

### Changed

- Publishes one commit per contract worktree and makes nested capability
  architecture routing resolve arbitrary workspace `src/**` depth through the
  canonical capability registry.
- Records research on composable agent-harness boundaries without adopting a
  second runtime authority.

### Fixed

- Makes architecture queue events semantically idempotent per changed file,
  including mixed severity and alternating capability prefixes, while keeping
  unchanged requests eligible for index self-healing.
- Serializes record/archive writers with a rollback-safe queue lock outside the
  architecture snapshot tree, adds crash recovery and recurrence handling, and
  rejects forged cards, unsafe symlink targets, and stale migration authority
  before mutation.
- Preserves committed Change Assessment oracle IDs through evidence
  redaction/materialization so assessment, selection-packet, and envelope
  fingerprints remain verifiable without exempting unrelated IDs or known
  secrets.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Adds a repo-level architecture-drift changed-set cursor as the single
  mutation authority used by Stop and manual drain paths. Multi-file patches
  and shell-written files now reach the same deterministic projection instead
  of depending on a single tool-reported path.

### Changed

- Cuts architecture cascade discovery over to the frozen Stop diff and retires
  the journal's architecture dirty bit, removing the duplicate authoring path
  while preserving cursor acknowledgement only after the cascade succeeds.
- Aligns the Claude planning brief with the architect-consultation packet and
  refreshes generated architecture projections against the 0.14.2 baseline.
- Clarifies the Codex native fleet contract against the 0.147 model catalog:
  Sol/Terra roots use the repository's v2 packet shape, while Luna-rooted v1
  sessions still discover custom agent roles through their distinct lifecycle
  surface.

### Fixed

- Keeps the architecture-drift cursor pending when the legacy cascade runner is
  unavailable, when the follow-up fails, or when manual drain cannot complete.
  A later Stop can therefore retry the same changed set instead of silently
  acknowledging lost work.

## [0.14.2] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Registers `zhaoxuya520/reverse-skill`'s `reverse-skill-router` as a recommended
  explicit-only external Skill for Claude and Codex, installed through
  `--with-reverse-skill`. It is deliberately excluded from both profiles
  because its upstream target-mention authorization assumption is not a valid
  repo-harness authority boundary. External provider projection is now
  catalog- and host-driven; the provider is commit-pinned and its selected tree
  is integrity-checked before host projection. Optional toolchains remain
  on-demand.

### Changed

- Makes native Codex `spawn_agent` with the exact installed `agent_type` the
  sole fleet identity/lifecycle authority. Official `SubagentStart` role/model
  evidence is now persisted even without advisor state; reasoning effort stays
  explicitly `configured_unverified`.
- Removes the Codex delegation-mode installer/config surface, SessionStart
  standing authorization, natural-language delegation inference, and
  App-thread/`codex-exec`/main-thread fleet fallbacks. `/delegate` and
  `/parallel` remain prompt-start typed commands. New contract templates select
  only `subagent` and declare no fallback; Stop no longer synthesizes a second
  dispatch instruction.
- Syncs the mandatory `archctx` / `archctx-contracts` closure to 0.4.2 across
  package pins, policy `projection_version`, `ARCHCTX_REQUIRED_VERSION`, the
  downstream policy templates, and eval fixtures.
- Bounds cross-review retries and adds an advisory skipped status.

### Fixed

- Reclaims the least-recently-used idle Streamable HTTP MCP session when a new
  `initialize` request reaches the configured session cap, while preserving
  sessions with in-flight requests. This prevents abandoned ChatGPT Connector
  reconnect sessions from accumulating until `SESSION_LIMIT_REACHED` (#174).
  `/health` now reports cumulative created, closed, expired, and evicted session
  counters for lifecycle diagnosis.
- Modernizes the axr5 clean-room integration proof for bun 1.3 install layouts:
  workspace packages link from the checkout's declared workspace list, consumer
  `file:` dependencies probe both install roots, and `prepareReleaseVersion`
  accepts an already-at-version source while still failing closed on a missing
  declaration. The proof is regenerated against the published archctx 0.4.2.
- Makes `repo-harness update` reconcile and read back its mandatory
  `archctx@0.4.2` and `archctx-contracts@0.4.2` dependency closure instead of
  trusting a successful Bun global install. A stale global dependency tree is
  reported with an explicit operator repair command; update never removes the
  working CLI before a replacement is known-good, and unresolved mismatches
  fail closed before host configuration is mutated.
- Propagates ArchContext's exact Node `>=24 <26` runtime contract, invokes the
  package-local ArchContext binary with a compatible PATH-owned Node, and
  reports a hard readiness error when that runtime is unavailable.
- Refreshes the exact CodeGraph CLI during update. Mutable third-party Waza and
  Mermaid providers remain behind explicit `--with-external-skills`; the
  ArchContext package-local CodeGraph and user-level CodeGraph MCP remain
  independently versioned and independently verified.
- Requires the complete ArchContext base model (`manifest.yaml`,
  `product.yaml`, and model nodes) before projection apply is reported as
  enabled.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Makes Markdown Mermaid the single architecture diagram artifact across the
  `repo-harness-architecture` skill, architecture queue follow-up prompt,
  generated architecture indexes, capability contract projections, and
  reference docs. Standalone HTML generation and discovery are removed;
  the external `mermaid` skill remains authoring/review-only.
- Adds regression coverage that renders a real architecture request and proves
  it contains the Mermaid-only instruction with no HTML artifact route, while
  preserving the existing consumer E2E invariant of zero architecture HTML.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Makes the public `archctx@0.4.0` runtime and
  `archctx-contracts@0.4.0` schema surface exact production dependencies when
  the ArchContext projection provider is enabled. The release keeps the
  package boundary fail-closed: no checkout overlay, global PATH fallback, or
  vendored diagram runtime is used.

### Changed

- Promotes this self-host repository's projection failure and architecture
  freshness gates from advisory to strict after AXR1-AXR7 proved the complete
  producer-to-consumer flow. Major module changes now enqueue an architecture
  refresh signal, the runtime drains the typed request through `archctx`, and
  Stop/readiness cannot report clean while a projection failure, dead letter,
  or qualifying stale request remains.
- Architecture documents remain Markdown with Mermaid `flowchart` and
  `sequenceDiagram` sources only. Mermaid validation stays an authoring-time
  skill/dev concern; the npm package contains no HTML or browser runtime.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-08-07

### Security

- Collapses every authored `.repo-harness/` gitignore projection to a single
  directory-level rule (#164). The generated managed block
  (`src/core/adoption/gitignore-plan.ts`) and the shell scaffold heredoc
  (`scripts/lib/project-init-lib.sh`) previously listed only two dead
  per-file entries, so the four files the MCP server actually writes under
  `<repo>/.repo-harness/` — including `mcp.oauth-tokens.json` holding OAuth
  access and refresh tokens — stayed NOT-IGNORED for any user who started
  `repo-harness mcp serve --transport http` without first running
  `mcp setup chatgpt` with repo scope. Nothing under `.repo-harness/` is
  intentionally tracked and `.repo-harness-owner.json` is not caught by the
  new rule. Retiring the repo config scope and the setup-time per-file
  compensation stays a separate slice.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-08-07

### Changed

- Ships the `repo-harness-hook` bin as a prepack-built single-file bundle
  `dist/hook-entry.js` instead of the live multi-file TypeScript tree. A
  registry reinstall now replaces one file atomically, so a hook firing inside
  the reinstall window can no longer resolve a half-replaced import graph and
  hang until the host's 30s adapter timeout. Two bounded source changes keep
  the bundle behavior-preserving: `src/cli/hook-entry.ts` gains an explicit
  `--detached-tooling-populate` dispatch branch, because `bun build` folds
  `session-context.ts`'s own `import.meta.main` bootstrap to `false` while
  `import.meta.url` retargets the respawn at the bundle, and both surfaces call
  the same exported `runDetachedToolingPopulate`; and
  `src/effects/evidence/post-bash-importer.ts` reads a build-time version
  literal injected by `bun build --define`, so the bundled provider id never
  emits the invented `0.0.0` that its `import.meta.url` path walk would produce
  once bundled. Managed adapter command strings, `timeout: 30`, and the
  `repo-harness` main bin mapping are byte-identical. Local symlink installs
  (`bun link`, `bun install -g <dir>`) bypass the packed bundle and need
  `bun run build:hook-bundle` once in the checkout; registry installs are the
  covered path.

### Fixed

- Keeps dynamic MCP OAuth clients alive past the absolute 30-day TTL while
  they still hold an unexpired access or refresh token (#161, #162). The
  cleanup predicate previously used registration time alone, so an actively
  refreshing ChatGPT connector was deleted at day 30 and its next refresh
  failed with `invalid_client`, forcing periodic re-authorization even under
  continuous use. Liveness is derived from existing token state — no new
  persisted field — so spam registrations that never completed authorization
  are still cleaned at 30 days, and a connector idle past 30 days still
  expires end to end.
- Raises the whole-round verification budget in `scripts/verify-contract.sh`
  from 600s to 1200s. The repo's own required `bun test` had outgrown the
  budget, so any contract listing it under `commands_succeed` deadlocked at the
  gate. The constant stays a fixed policy line; no environment override was
  added.
- Raises `VERIFIER_HELPER_TIMEOUT_MS` in `src/cli/runtime/helper-runner.ts`
  from 720s to 1260s so the outer process wrapper sits strictly above the inner
  whole-round budget plus a 60s margin. Previously a 720-1200s round died as a
  mute process kill with no run snapshot and no `budget_ms`, which made the
  evidence-emitting inner gate unreachable for long rounds.
- Retains a failing criterion's runner log at
  `.ai/harness/runs/<run-id>-<criterion-slug>.log` instead of destroying it
  with the round's temp directory. Run reports previously recorded only
  `exit_code`, so a failing `bun test` criterion could not be attributed to a
  test at all. Passing criteria retain nothing, and a retention failure warns
  without changing the round's verdict.
- Makes five load-sensitive tests robust under machine load. Three
  subprocess-heavy `tests/continuation-attempt.test.ts` cases now carry
  explicit 30s timeouts instead of dying at bun's default 5000ms; the bounded
  spawn-error ceiling in `tests/unit/closeout-runner-guardrails.test.ts` widens
  to 5s with its `timedOut === false` fence unchanged; and a `Bun.sleep(100)`
  race there becomes an event race on the production drain-then-release
  ordering, which also gains a vacuity guard the sleep version lacked.


## [0.13.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Adds the long-run continuation protocol, which moves "what runs next" out of
  chat context and into durable repository state. `repo-harness state next
  --json` emits a `ContinuationEnvelopeV1` carrying one of six routes —
  `continue_active_plan`, `advance_sprint`, `verify_or_finish`, `halt`,
  `complete`, `idle` — plus the command the host should run and a
  `progress_token`. The command is read-only and deterministic: identical
  repository bytes and identical receipt-ledger bytes yield byte-identical
  JSON, and it never creates a plan, contract, or worktree, never advances the
  sprint, and never authorizes more than one bounded unit or one halt per call.
  Row selection stays with `sprint-backlog`; the envelope only names the
  command. `halt` reuses the existing Effective State and sprint vocabularies
  rather than inventing its own, and there is no `ask` or `wait` route — a
  needs-user state is a halt whose reason points at the blocker.
- Adds `repo-harness state attempt`, which records one `AttemptReceiptV1` per
  bounded turn — `unit_ref`, outcome, and the before/after envelope
  `progress_token` pair — to the ignored ledger at
  `.ai/harness/runs/continuation/attempts.jsonl`. Receipts are liveness
  evidence, never authority: they answer only "did this turn move anything".
  Two consecutive `completed` receipts on the same `unit_ref` with an unchanged
  token trip a no-progress circuit breaker, so the next envelope returns
  `halt:no_progress`; a token change clears it, and `--outcome resumed` is the
  operator's only explicit override. An unreadable ledger fails closed as
  `halt:attempt_ledger_unreadable` instead of being treated as an empty
  history. Two independent mechanisms — the gitignore rule and
  `isOperationalReviewPath`'s `.ai/harness/runs/` prefix — keep the ledger out
  of `progress_token`, and either alone suffices, so writing a receipt can
  never look like the progress that would clear the breaker.
- Makes contract closeout crash-durable. `contract-worktree finish` and
  `ship-worktrees` now run as an exclusively owned, journalled transaction:
  before any journal, lifecycle write, commit, push, or PR, the caller
  atomically creates a worktree-scoped claim directory under
  `<git-common-dir>/repo-harness/transactions/claims/`, so simultaneous callers
  contend on `mkdir` and every loser fails closed before the first side effect.
  The owner then writes a `CloseoutJournalV1` with one fsync'd record per phase
  (`prepared` through `complete`) via temp file plus atomic rename, and
  releases its claim only on a terminal status. Claims and journals live under
  the git common dir, outside every working tree, so they survive worktree
  removal. An interrupted closeout fails closed — a plain rerun refuses while
  an `in_progress` journal or a claim exists — and recovery is explicit:
  `recover inspect` reports the claim, owner PID liveness, and recorded phases;
  `recover abort` restores the pre-closeout snapshot and is the only way to
  clear a dead pre-journal orphan claim; `recover reconcile` completes the
  missing steps after an external effect landed, never re-merging, re-pushing,
  or duplicating a PR. A mutating recovery first proves the recorded owner PID
  is dead, then takes the claim's nested `recovery.lock` lane; it never steals
  from a live owner, and nothing reclaims a stale claim automatically.
  Per-phase `SIGKILL` fault injection and concurrent double-start race tests
  cover the transaction.
- Publishes the host conformance contract at
  `docs/reference-configs/long-run-continuation.md`: the seven-step tick, the
  per-route host action table, the halt vocabulary, the crash-recovery
  semantics, and the operator remedy for each halt reason. A conformance suite
  runs the whole tick — opening envelope, one bounded unit, closing envelope,
  attempt receipt, post-receipt envelope — inside a disposable repository,
  selecting routes and commands only from the envelope it just read, and binds
  both arms of the receipt-invisibility invariant.
- Adds a sprint-backlog grammar drift check that binds the TypeScript backlog
  reader to `sprint-backlog.sh` over shared fixtures covering statuses, row
  shapes, section bounds, and CRLF input, so the two readers cannot diverge on
  the grammar they both parse.

## [0.12.3] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Adds `MainLoopDispatchGuard`, an opt-in Claude-host edit boundary that
  separates orchestrator edits from subagent edits. Armed only by
  `REPO_HARNESS_MAIN_LOOP_EDIT_GUARD=1|true` together with
  `HOOK_HOST=claude`, it denies main-loop `Edit`/`Write` on code-extension
  files and returns a dispatch-to-subagent instruction; Claude Code stamps
  `agent_id`/`agent_type` onto the payload only inside a subagent, so an
  absent pair identifies the orchestrator thread. Subagent edits and
  non-code paths such as plans, docs, and config pass through unchanged.
  The check is a strong boundary, evaluated per path and independent of
  plan state, spec presence, and workflow-profile resolution, so the
  dispatch instruction lands before any plan advisory. The product default
  is off; unsetting the variable is the operator off-switch.

### Fixed

- Hook fixtures that pin `HOOK_HOST=claude` now strip or neutralize
  `REPO_HARNESS_MAIN_LOOP_EDIT_GUARD` at the fixture boundary, so an armed
  operator shell can no longer arm the new guard inside frozen
  characterization runs and flip their recorded goldens.

## [0.12.2] - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- Makes Codex App Threads the preferred delegation runner. The orchestrator
  reads each role's exact model and reasoning effort from the installed
  `~/.codex/agents/<role>.toml`; native `spawn_agent` is now a fail-closed
  fallback only when its live schema can carry the same tuple. The canonical
  policy, hook advice, standing authorization, downstream initializer seeds,
  and helper mirror all carry the same routing contract.
- Converges packaged fleet authorship on `agents/fleet/`: tracked repo-level
  Claude agent copies are removed, Codex TOMLs remain generated installer
  fixtures, and gatekeeper maps to the Terra/xhigh Codex profile through the
  existing role mapping authority.
- Records the live App Thread canary and its version-bound readiness limit:
  Codex CLI `0.146.0-alpha.9.2` honored the requested fast-worker tuple, while
  the public materialized-thread readback still omits model and effort. That
  result remains unverified at the portable orchestrator contract and selects
  the declared fallback instead of inferring readiness from private host data.

### Fixed

- Agent-fleet health checks now honor hash-bound user-managed receipts, so an
  accepted local role override reports as user-managed instead of permanent
  drift; absent, malformed, or stale receipts still fail closed.
- Receipt update-check tests now stub their upstream fetches, removing eight
  real network calls per affected path and the resulting deterministic timeout
  on slower networks.
- Bounded verifier children now remove every inherited
  `REPO_HARNESS_*` variable at the spawn boundary, preventing helper routing
  metadata from overriding fixture isolation inside nested test commands.
- Acceptance finalization strips materializer-owned `provenance` before
  re-emitting its run trace, so the published checks projection's recorded
  content hash is self-consistent with its own bytes.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-08-01

### Changed

- Restructures the five-language README suite into a get-started-first
  layout (centered header, TOC, Get Started section, key-features table),
  cutting the English `README.md` from 872 to 451 lines; deep-dive content
  (install profiles, General Repo MCP, harness overview, hook operations)
  moves into `docs/reference-configs` before deletion so nothing is lost,
  and the four translations (zh-CN, ja, fr, es) are rewritten against the
  new section structure.
- Bumps the `@colbymchenry/codegraph` dev dependency from `1.4.1` to
  `1.5.0`.

### Fixed

- `hook-events.jsonl`'s `run_id` was always empty and each evidence writer
  minted its own `run-${Date.now()}` on demand, so hook telemetry never
  joined evidence `correlation_run_id`. A new `run-identity.ts` module is
  now the single SessionStart-only mint and resolution authority (payload
  -> `HOOK_RUN_ID` -> `CODEX_RUN_ID` -> `CLAUDE_RUN_ID` -> session-state
  lookup -> null), storing one bounded `session-run-identity.json` slot;
  `event-telemetry.ts` and `command-observed.ts` now wire to this unified
  resolver instead of independent chains or self-minted fallbacks.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Adds `deep-worker` to the managed agent fleet (`.claude/agents/`,
  `.codex/agents/`, `agents/fleet/`): an Opus/high-effort heavy execution
  worker for cross-module refactors, tricky concurrency or state fixes, and
  other hard changes that must land right in one pass.

### Changed

- Breaking: `repo-harness adopt` is removed with no alias or compatibility
  stub (`repo-harness adopt` now fails closed with commander's
  `unknown command 'adopt'`). `repo-harness init` takes over repo-local
  adoption byte-for-byte (same flags and rollback positional). The former
  duplicate global-bootstrap `repo-harness init` block, including its
  `--refresh` compatibility no-op, is removed; `repo-harness install` is now
  the sole global/host-level bootstrap entrypoint. Pre-cutover transaction
  manifests keep rolling back unmodified: their frozen protocol-1
  `"command": "adopt"` literal is unchanged on disk, so
  `repo-harness init rollback --transaction <path>` still accepts them.
- `fast-worker` moves from Sonnet at max effort to Opus at medium effort
  with an explicit max-target override; the default Codex model projection
  for the `opus` family is respecified accordingly, and pinned model
  versions are dropped in favor of the effort-tier projection.
- `docs/reference-configs/` is now a generated projection of the shipped
  `assets/reference-configs/` source. `scripts/sync-reference-configs.ts
  --check/--write` keeps all 23 mirrored pairs in sync and is wired into
  `check-ci`; the README and reference-config test suites also drop
  scattered duplicate assertions that never caught a regression, in favor
  of one inventory-driven projection guard.

### Fixed

- MCP allowed-root policy no longer denies roots under an OS realpath
  canonicalization prefix such as `/private/tmp` on macOS; only that
  prefix is stripped before the `private/**` deny glob runs, so a genuine
  `private`/`secrets`/`node_modules` segment elsewhere in the path still
  denies.
- `ensure-task-workflow`'s bootstrap now writes the resume packet after the
  current-status snapshot instead of before, closing a same-second
  write-order race that made `check-task-workflow --strict`'s whole-second
  mtime comparison fail nondeterministically (1 of 12 idle runs before the
  fix).
- `acceptance-receipt`'s verification-evidence fingerprint now hashes
  through the existing `stableJson()` canonicalizer instead of raw
  `JSON.stringify`, so a semantics-preserving key-order difference between
  the evidence ledger's inline (under the 8192-byte cap) and blob storage
  paths for `checks/latest.json` no longer flips
  `verification_evidence_sha256` and fails acceptance closed as stale.
- `contract-worktree` cleanup now recognizes a squash-merged branch as
  absorbed via an exact `git merge-tree` tree-equality fallback instead of
  ancestry alone, and deletes absorbed branches with `git branch -D` while
  still using `-d` for plain ancestor merges — closing the half-completed
  cleanup (worktree removed, branch left behind) that unconditional `-d`
  caused on every squash-absorbed package.

## [0.11.3] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Adds ChatGPT delegate mode: a repo-owned, transport-agnostic dual-agent GPT
  Pro protocol (task brief with `EXECUTION_BOUNDARY`, a sentinel envelope
  bound to baseline/bundle SHA-256, a baseline snapshot including WIP diff,
  isolated-worktree acceptance with no 3-way merge rescue, and bounded
  2-round escalation) over two explicit host transports: Claude through the
  existing Oracle consult/continue chain, and Codex through its built-in
  browser with visible-completion and sentinel authority.

### Fixed

- The ChatGPT delegate engine now runs a mandatory Gitleaks scan over the
  exact rendered PromptBundle bytes (prompt, inline files, and followups)
  before any session-store write or provider spawn, failing closed on a
  missing binary, an incompatible version, unparsable output, or findings;
  followup consults inherit the scan requirement from session metadata and
  cannot opt out.
- Added explicit, opt-in `install-skill`/`uninstall-skill` host projection
  commands for the previously undiscoverable `repo-harness-chatgpt` package,
  using realpath-validated symlinks that fail closed on unowned destinations
  and roll back idempotently.
- Updated the skill-surface pin to cover the new `references/delegate.md`
  reference (6 references total) and raised the router byte limit from 2048
  to 2560.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Hook command context no longer emits a per-call `[ChecksFile]` line, removing
  repeated static noise while retaining the canonical checks artifact as
  queryable workflow state.
- Capability and TDD jurisdiction now classify paths outside the repository as
  out of scope without weakening traversal, NUL-byte, or Win32 path validation.
- `SessionStart` now resolves Effective State in process instead of spawning the
  repo's own CLI. The shared bounded transient retry path preserves host-hook
  liveness, distinguishes resolved blockers from unavailable authority, and
  persists only normalized, redaction-safe unavailable diagnostics.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-07-24

### Changed

- Host install profiles are now exactly `minimal` and `full`: minimal projects
  7 Codex hooks, full projects all 11 and is the default for fresh and
  adapter-only installs. The former 5-hook tier and the steady-state
  `standard`/`product-planning`/`strict` install names are retired. Installed
  state is protocol 2; protocol-1 state fails closed on normal reads and moves
  only through `repo-harness install --migrate-profile-state --profile
  minimal|full`, with transaction-owned removal and compensation.
- Workflow status and archive closeout now converge on the same typed acceptance
  authority: historical terminal classification requires a fulfilled contract,
  passing review projection, and typed receipt, while archive prediction binds
  the scratch candidate before attaching acceptance dependencies.

### Fixed

- User-managed agent-fleet installs can now be explicitly accepted without
  overwriting local role definitions; the acceptance stays bound to validated
  role identity and exact installed bytes.
- Evidence materialization now honors immutable genesis authority instead of
  allowing a later projection to substitute a new ledger origin.
- Contract verification canonicalizes human scorecard labels to the machine
  criterion keys, preventing valid QA evidence from failing on display names.
- Effective State concurrency tests now publish mutator readiness only after
  counter initialization, closing the pre-initialization observation race.
- Claude skill-routing provider subprocesses now isolate setting sources to the
  case project instead of inheriting unrelated host configuration.
- Primary-worktree shipping now forwards an empty optional child-argument list
  without triggering `unbound variable` under macOS system Bash 3.2, while
  preserving exact `--dry-run` and `--ready` argument values.
- Newly adopted repos now ignore `.ai/harness/evidence/`, and review-subject
  normalization classifies the ledger as operational state, so authoritative
  evidence emission cannot make its own acceptance subject stale.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-23

### Changed

- `checks/latest.json` is now materialized exclusively from the
  `EvidenceEvent` ledger (D7 selection predicate: exact worktree + subject +
  admitted trust class, last accepted event wins). Every prior direct
  authoring path is deleted in the same package that replaced it:
  `verify-sprint.sh`'s `cp` onto `checks/latest.json`, the
  `workflow_ensure_harness_surface` `{}` bootstrap, and
  `mutation-observed.ts`'s continuous contract-verification cascade (now
  redirected to a dedicated `.ai/harness/checks/contract-verify.latest.json`,
  never the acceptance-evidence path).
- Recovery views (`handoff/current.md`, `handoff/resume.md`) render from one
  standalone materializer, single-hop from the EPC-06 checkpoint plus
  minimal live workflow context. The independent bash `workflow_write_handoff`
  content assembly, `codex-handoff-resume.sh`'s elaborate-resume assembly,
  `prepare-codex-handoff.sh`'s Node/Python global-packet splice, and
  `workflow_ensure_harness_surface`'s handoff/resume placeholder bootstrap
  are all retired same-package; the three bash entrypoints are now thin
  invokers of one standalone CLI (`scripts/recovery-view-cli.ts`).
- The SessionStart Context Packet's resume-availability check
  (`resumeAvailable()`) now resolves from the canonical checkpoint-backed
  evidence reader (`resolveRecoveryEvidence`) instead of re-deriving
  availability by string-scanning `resume.md` for a legacy marker/header.
- Evidence-ledger redaction gained a typed-field exemption: a whole-value
  declared hash (`sha256:`-prefixed or bare 40/64-hex) or a declared/inferred
  safe repo-relative path is exempt from high-entropy redaction, so a
  realistic long contract slug or a `sha256:`-prefixed field now survives
  materialization byte-identical instead of being partially hash-mangled.
  The secret-value denylist still runs unconditionally over every field,
  exempted or not.
- PostBash-observed command results and manual/external attested acceptance
  receipts now import into the same `EvidenceEvent` ledger (`observed` and
  `external_attested`/`human_acceptance` trust classes respectively),
  feeding the materializers above under the frozen D4 trust matrix.

### Removed

- **Skill surface discovery convergence (public cutover, next-minor breaking
  change).** `assets/skill-commands/manifest.json` v2 is now the runtime
  discovery authority for Skill package classification and host/profile
  projection. Rule owners converge from 25 Skill-like sources to 10 canonical
  packages (`repo-harness`, `repo-harness-setup`, `repo-harness-plan`,
  `repo-harness-product`, `repo-harness-check`, `repo-harness-ship`,
  `repo-harness-architecture`, `repo-harness-cross-review`, `merge-gate`
  classification-only, `repo-harness-chatgpt`); the 19 retired names below are
  deleted (no directories, no generated aliases, no compatibility shims) and
  recorded only as migration metadata in the manifest's `retiredPackages`
  array:

  | Retired name | Replacement |
  |---|---|
  | `repo-harness-init` | `repo-harness-setup` (adopt-init mode) |
  | `repo-harness-migrate` | `repo-harness-setup` (migrate mode) |
  | `repo-harness-upgrade` | `repo-harness-setup` (upgrade mode) |
  | `repo-harness-repair` | `repo-harness-setup` (repair mode) |
  | `repo-harness-scaffold` | `repo-harness-setup` (scaffold mode) |
  | `repo-harness-capability` | `repo-harness-setup` (capability mode) |
  | `repo-harness-review` | `repo-harness-plan` (review mode) |
  | `repo-harness-prd` | `repo-harness-product` (PRD mode) |
  | `repo-harness-sprint` | `repo-harness-product` (Sprint mode) |
  | `repo-harness-goal` | `repo-harness-product` (Goal mode) |
  | `repo-harness-handoff` | root `repo-harness` (handoff action + `references/handoff.md`) |
  | `repo-harness-deploy` | `repo-harness-check` (deploy-readiness reference) |
  | `repo-harness-autoplan` | retired, no successor; root `execute` already follows Effective State through the existing plan -> contract -> worktree -> verify -> ship chain. Its Reusable Workflow Packaging Rubric survives alone as `references/workflow-packaging-rubric.md` |
  | `repo-harness-gptpro` | `repo-harness-chatgpt` (consult/continue modes) |
  | `repo-harness-gptpro-setup` | `repo-harness-chatgpt` (setup mode) |
  | `codex-review` | `repo-harness-cross-review` (Codex provider mode) |
  | `claude-review` | `repo-harness-cross-review` (Claude provider mode) |
  | `repo-harness-chatgpt-bridge` (static `.agents/skills/` copy) | `repo-harness-chatgpt` (bridge reference); the generated runtime projection identity `repo-harness-chatgpt-bridge` is unchanged |
  | `repo-harness-chatgpt-browser` (static `.agents/skills/` copy) | `repo-harness-chatgpt` (continue reference); the underlying `src/cli/chatgpt-browser` CLI engine is unaffected |

  Target discovery matrix: `minimal` -> `repo-harness` only; `standard` ->
  adds `repo-harness-plan` and `repo-harness-check`; `product-planning` ->
  adds `repo-harness-product`; `strict` -> `repo-harness-plan`,
  `repo-harness-check`, `repo-harness-ship`, host-aware
  `repo-harness-cross-review` on both hosts, and `merge-gate` only on its
  gatekeeper host. `repo-harness-chatgpt` is explicit-setup only and never
  implied by `product-planning` or any other profile.

### Notes (accepted intermediate states -- operator guidance)

- Downstream adopters that installed via the packaged CLI (not this source
  checkout) do not yet receive the ledger/materializer tooling
  (`emit-verify-evidence.ts` and friends are source-repo-only, never
  registered in the distributed helper manifest); `checks/latest.json` stays
  structurally absent in those repos until the next release ships this
  cutover. This is a pre-existing condition, not a regression introduced
  here.
- A globally installed `repo-harness` CLI published before this cutover is a
  live legacy writer until refreshed. Operator guidance: refresh with the
  standard install profile (`repo-harness update --profile standard`, or
  `install --profile standard` for a fresh install) to pick up the
  materializer-only behavior; until then, invoke `bash scripts/verify-sprint.sh`
  directly in a self-hosted worktree rather than `repo-harness run
  verify-sprint`, so the stale global binary's own retired `cp` path cannot
  silently re-clobber `checks/latest.json` with old-schema content.
- The guarded, only-if-absent `{}` seeds in `scripts/plan-to-todo.sh` and
  `scripts/ensure-task-workflow.sh` (project-genesis scaffolding for a
  brand-new adopted repo, gated `if [[ ! -f ... ]]`) remain non-ledger
  first-writers by design -- fail-closed, never overwriting real
  materialized content, and out of scope for this cutover.

### Verification

- Added a cross-package projection-drift suite
  (`tests/evidence-projection-drift.test.ts`): the checkpoint machine/human
  views, the recovery views, materialized `checks/latest`, and tracked
  `tasks/current.md` all recompute byte/hash-identically from their declared
  sources, both on a fixture ledger and (where live state exists) against
  this worktree's own published evidence.
- Added a deprecation-residue scan (`tests/evidence-residue-scan.test.ts`)
  consuming a checked-in retired-surfaces list
  (`evals/harness/epc-retired-surfaces.json`, the union of every EPC-05/07/08
  deletion) -- zero unexcepted hits across `src/`, `scripts/`, `.ai/hooks/`,
  `assets/`.
- A matched post-EPC benchmark run was attempted at the post-EPC-08 subject
  under the frozen VGBR-R protocol (one authoritative invocation, no
  `--profile`/`--scenario`/`--regrade-existing`). The attempt
  (`post-epc-196e787a-20260723-a01`) self-classified `failed_during_run`:
  two `adaptive-lite` arms failed inside the runner's own isolated per-arm
  sandboxes (a provider tool-exec fault and a harness-guard-blocked agent
  turn -- see `docs/researches/20260723-epc-program-closeout.research.md`
  for the full evidence). No report was produced and none was promoted. Per
  the sprint's own frozen attempt discipline, one protocol-clean failed
  attempt is sufficient to trigger row 13's cannot-execute fallback -- no
  second attempt was made, and no automatic rerun or `--regrade-existing`
  backfill occurred. **Fallback applied**: the pre-EPC baseline triplet
  (27/27 arms, `evals/harness/reports/profile-comparison.*`, bytes
  untouched) is now designated **"descriptive pre-EPC baseline only"**.
  This release closeout claims no benchmark improvement over the pre-EPC
  baseline.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-07-15

### Changed

- Moved Effective State v1 policy and projection into pure `src/core` modules,
  isolated repository/Git/lock/cache work under `src/effects`, and kept CLI and
  hook entrypoints as adapters without changing protocol `1`, public command
  names, field ordering, or exit semantics.
- Made `summarize_repo_harness_state` derive its compact state from the same
  canonical resolver as CLI and hooks. `tasks/current.md` remains an explicitly
  non-authoritative projection and is no longer parsed as MCP state authority.
- Replaced the handwritten capability-registry shadow validator with one pure
  parser/validator/longest-prefix matcher. The adopted-repository helper is now
  a deterministic standalone Bun projection bound to the canonical source hash.

### Fixed

- Made authoritative plan, policy, and capability-registry reads fail closed:
  only `ENOENT` means absent, and malformed or unreadable state-influencing
  policy metadata now aborts before cache or version publication. Policy paths
  are contained under both POSIX and Win32 grammars, and worktree/common-dir
  canonicalization faults no longer degrade to raw paths or version `0`.
- Hardened repository and Git-common-dir locks against symlink ancestors and
  pathname token races. Unique token files are reclaimed by exact name, empty
  pre-token directories and live/unknown PID identities stay fail closed, and
  linked worktrees serialize through the Git common-dir.
- Made Effective State publication one cache-first/version-owner-last
  transaction with exact cache rollback, so cache or owner faults cannot expose
  a consumed version or half-published authoritative state. Removed the unused
  standalone cache-writer export that could bypass that transaction.

### Verification

- Added 12-scenario public-path goldens: CLI matches requested-risk resolution,
  hook and MCP match direct `inspect`, and repository authority fields remain
  identical across that intentional policy delta. Lock/cache/source-mutation
  fault coverage, a state-boundary gate, and packed-artifact state/helper smokes
  cover the converged boundary.
- Kept ESA-06 workflow-artifact writer semantics deferred; this release adds no
  overwrite compatibility mode or alternate authority.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Added optional `.ai/harness/policy.json#operations.deploy_sql` authority for established alternate SQL roots, naming modes, and invariant files. Generated policies keep the existing `deploy/sql/` plus `ordered4` default when the object is absent, and hooks, deploy guidance, and scaffolds now describe the same precedence.
- Replaced global Strict cognitive choreography with a risk-aware harness
  kernel. Deterministic `lite`/`standard`/`strict` workflow profiles are now
  computed from a single risk floor (target-path scope, cross-capability
  signals, and strict-category path tokens); explicit-first prompt routing
  lets ordinary prompts bypass workflow classification entirely, while only
  explicit or active-task requests route through a workflow action. A single
  global SessionStart context budget (<=1,500 estimated tokens) applies
  deterministic critical-field compaction and structured fail-closed
  overflow instead of per-producer truncation. One effective-state resolver
  — `repo-harness state resolve --json` — carries task, profile, version,
  authority, hashes, freshness, next-action, and blockers, and is injected
  into sessions as the `[HarnessState]` block. Five categories of circuit
  breakers (guard repeat, review, subagent, repair, and cross-model) now
  bound orchestration loops with fail-closed limits. Host runtime install is
  now transactional, with `minimal`/`standard`/`product-planning`/`strict`
  install profiles (`repo-harness install --profile <profile>`) each
  carrying a deterministic plan/apply, idempotent switching, rollback, and
  installed-state status.
- Added `repo-harness state resolve --field <name>` to project a single
  resolved field from the effective-state resolver in one call, removing a
  redundant parse subprocess from the PreToolUse edit guard. The profile
  benchmark report now records per-run `artifact_files` paths alongside the
  existing artifact count, and SessionStart guidance binds ceremony
  expectations (authoring plan/contract/notes files) to the resolved
  workflow profile: lite sessions get zero ceremony, standard sessions get
  at most the single active-plan artifact, and strict is unchanged.

### Fixed

- Preserved the recorded install profile during ordinary `repo-harness update`
  instead of silently projecting `minimal`, and rejected persisted ownership
  paths outside the exact managed-surface allowlist before profile-switch
  deletion.
- Made the packaged root Skill resolve detailed guidance through
  `repo-harness docs show <id>` and added installed-tarball smoke coverage for
  both referenced documents.
- Hardened the unshipped coding MCP surface: setup now validates every grant
  and fallible option before committing `read_write`; OAuth rate limits use
  direct-socket, canonical-route identities with bounded buckets; dynamic
  clients have fixed expiry/capacity; and the unreachable Bun PTY schema and
  `node-pty` dependency were removed while pipe stdin, polling, SIGINT, and
  process-tree cleanup remain supported.
- Removed the external `gbrain` tooling dependency from setup/adoption policy,
  install choices, readiness detection, generated guidance, and migration
  routing. Brain-vault export remains an explicit operator command, while
  PostEdit, sprint verification, and strict workflow checks no longer sync or
  gate on external vault state.
- Closed a guard gap where a batched `apply_patch` never showed the
  deterministic risk floor its full pending scope: each recursive per-file
  check now resolves against every path in the batch, so a medium-scope
  batch (four or more implementation paths) or a batch containing one
  strict-category path promotes standard/strict for every path in the same
  atomic action, instead of the bypass where sequential per-file checks
  never saw siblings not yet on disk. Hardened the capability-registry and
  implementation-surface inputs that feed the same risk floor: an absent,
  corrupt, or non-array capability registry now returns a structured,
  fail-closed reason instead of silently collapsing to zero capabilities,
  and one implementation-surface predicate now owns medium-scope path
  counting (shared by the TS resolver and a projected shell case list) so a
  docs-only batch can no longer inflate the internally resolved profile.
- Fixed skill-facade retirement to remove an owner-marked host copy whose
  canonical package source is gone, instead of refusing the whole sync when
  any single facade was dropped from the package; `repo-harness-gptpro` now
  installs under the `product-planning` and `strict` profiles.
- Isolated workflow gate test fixtures from the host repo-harness environment:
  fixture subprocesses strip `REPO_HARNESS_*`/`HOOK_REPO_ROOT` so a fixture
  `verify-sprint.sh` can no longer follow an inherited
  `REPO_HARNESS_TARGET_REPO_ROOT` back into the real repository and
  recursively execute the real contract gate.

### Changed

- Decoupled benchmark evidence production from contract verification. Verify
  gates now consume tracked report bytes plus provenance instead of
  live-running the authoritative 3x9 matrix (a full matrix run stays a
  one-shot, author-run evidence step before merge), review fingerprints bind
  acceptance to implementation content — `base_ref`/`base_rev` are demoted to
  non-hashed metadata, so unrelated target advances, clean rebases, and
  acceptance-recording commits no longer stale a recorded acceptance while
  same-file target changes still do — and the Human Review Card
  external-acceptance fallback is removed: canonical `## External Acceptance
  Advice` is the sole authority and the gate accepts only `pass` or
  `manual_override`. Benchmark arms delete their disposable host toolchain
  root after result extraction, bounding temporary-space growth without
  touching arm timing or the retained regrade workspaces.
- Removed gstack from active planning routes, generated policy, readiness
  detection, and install/update guidance. Product discovery and complex/design
  planning now stay with the parent agent: `geju` opens the pre-contract frame,
  the parent completes P1/P2/P3, and the accepted result is frozen directly
  into the plan and contract without an alias, fallback, or compatibility path.
- Expanded the repo-owned agent fleet from four to six roles with
  `root-cause-prover` for bounded pre-fix bug evidence and
  `harness-evaluator` for existing skill/adoption evaluation in disposable
  state. Migration auditing is an evaluator profile, BDD2 remains an explicit
  forbidden authority, and native Explore stays an informal host capability
  rather than a prompt-inheritance or alias surface.
- Replaced the remote `Fable-agents` fleet dependency with the npm-packaged
  `agents/fleet/*.md` authority. The installer now operates offline, validates
  all six sources before mutation, projects the managed fleet to both hosts,
  preserves effort strings across the Sol/Luna family map,
  and keeps gatekeeper read-only in both sandbox and prompt semantics.
- Kept native MultiAgentV2 role selection behind a runtime canary instead of
  treating installed TOML as runtime proof. Role identity checks remain
  structure-aware, and a valid packaged source can repair a stale installed
  target whose declared identity belongs to another managed role. The package
  and installer require Bun >=
  1.1.35, the first supported runtime boundary for stdin execution plus semantic
  parsing of the generated multiline TOML agents, and reject older runtimes
  before creating user-level state. The Unix and Windows bootstrap installers
  now upgrade older Bun runtimes instead of trusting unenforced engine metadata,
  and incomplete source validation fails before any installed target mutation.
  The CLI's global
  `install`, `init`, and mutating `update` paths bind setup subprocesses to the
  exact Bun executable they validate and enforce the same floor, closing direct
  `bunx`/`bun add`/`npx` entrypoints that bypass the top-level bootstrap scripts.
  Self-installer-owned Bun can upgrade in place; package-manager-owned Bun fails
  closed with its manager command instead of overwriting manager state. Read-only
  update checks remain mutation-free.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- Updated the generated Codex agent fleet so `deep-reasoner` and `gatekeeper`
  use GPT-5.6 Sol with `xhigh` reasoning, while `fast-worker` uses GPT-5.6
  Terra with `medium` reasoning; generated descriptions now fail closed when the
  upstream provider label does not match the declared model mapping.
- Added the shared Rule 0, first-principles reasoning, and generality guidance
  to global working-rule distribution and newly scaffolded root agent context.

### Fixed

- Pinned the documented `bunx`/`npx` bootstrap and prompt-guard recovery paths
  to `repo-harness@latest`, and made an already-installed Bun global runtime
  surface an opt-in, repository-isolated update hint instead of silently
  perpetuating a stale version.
- Made `repo-harness doctor` run Bun registry lookup from the package root,
  require the stable PATH-visible Codex CLI to be at least `0.144.0`, and keep
  Claude-only setup free of irrelevant Codex warnings.
- Made explicit direct-change-and-commit requests enter hook execution while
  generic change language, questions, quoted text, negation, and contractions
  remain non-execution intent.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Added `repo-harness install --target codex|both --location global
  --delegation-mode auto|explicit`, plus the matching interactive TTY prompt,
  so users can persist the global Codex delegation mode in
  `~/.repo-harness/config.json` without clobbering existing config keys.
- Added an exact `archctx-contracts@0.2.1` devDependency and moved
  `archcontext-boundaries-v1` export tests from a vendored schema fixture to
  the package's authoritative schema/validator surface.
- Added a read-only `repo.adopt-refresh` setup-check advisory: with
  `--check-updates`, adopted repos now surface an Agent action when the
  `repo-harness adopt` dry-run plan has pending operations.

### Changed

- Updated the shell and PowerShell install scripts to point new users at
  `repo-harness install` instead of the compatibility `init` alias, and to
  print a PATH hint when Bun's bin directory was not already visible in the
  original shell.
- Moved Waza and Geju setup-check probes and docs from `npx -y skills ...` to
  `bunx skills ...`, keeping the release line Bun-first.
- Made the Codex delegation advisor honor `delegation.mode=auto` from either
  the global user config or repo policy, while keeping discussion prompts quiet
  and disabling stop-fallback for implicit auto-mode injections.
- Added `.archcontext/` to the self-host and generated-repo ignore surfaces so
  local arch-context model scaffolds stay out of commits by default.
- Removed the local `tests/fixtures/archcontext/architecture-node.subset.schema.json`
  fixture now that `archctx-contracts@0.2.1` publishes the required schemas.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Added a `bugfix` task profile with a first-class Root Cause Evidence gate:
  `contract-run.ts` and `verify-contract.sh` independently evaluate the same
  `## Root Cause Evidence` section against shared fixtures, matching a
  pre-fix failure artifact by its captured `PRE_FIX_EXIT` recipe; added the
  bugfix golden example `docs/reference-configs/contract-brief-example-bugfix.md`.
- Declared file-coupled delegation policy (`delegation.preferred_runners` /
  `fallback_runner` / `runner_rule`) that makes the task contract the
  authoritative execution brief and the native subagent an optional
  accelerator; slimmed `codex-delegation-advisor` to point at the contract
  instead of commanding native spawn limits; `plan-to-todo` now prints a
  non-blocking `[BriefPreflight]` advisory right after contract projection,
  while `contract-run.ts run` keeps the fail-closed brief-completeness gate.
- Added an optional `## Falsifier` section to the contract template and
  aligned all five template/helper-mirror copies, backfilling the
  Why/Stop-Conditions/Exemplar sections seeded for prompt distillation.
  Distilled the contract-run prompts on top of that: `writePrompt()` folds
  self-verify/notes/stop duties and Intent into the worker/verifier prompts,
  `runBriefPreflight()` requires a concrete `## Why`, a golden contract-brief
  example ships with a preflight guard test, `verify-sprint` prints
  promotion/triage advisories at finish without changing its exit code,
  `contract-run.ts` gained a `--runner` option with manifest `runner_usage`
  recording, and the workflow is taught across the repo's `SKILL.md` docs.
- Added geju (`hylarucoder/hai-stack`) as an `external_tooling` dependency;
  `plan-to-todo` prints a `[Geju]` artifact-freeze advisory after rendering a
  contract.
- Made the agent fleet a first-class dependency: a `fable_agents` policy
  entry (self-host `auto-install-on-init`, downstream `advisory`), the
  `install-agent-fleet` helper (direct-installs upstream `.md` agent
  definitions and generates matching Codex `.toml` mappings, never-clobber by
  default with `--force` to override, `REPO_HARNESS_FLEET_SOURCE_DIR`
  override), `check-agent-tooling`'s `detectAgentFleet()` with
  strict-readiness (`missing`/`partial`), and tiered init/migrate policy
  assembly where dry-run never writes to `$HOME`.
- Added the `codex-subagent` runner label and committed this repo's own
  fleet: three `.claude/agents/` definitions (`deep-reasoner`, `fast-worker`,
  `gatekeeper`) with symmetric `.codex/agents/*.toml` mappings.
- Made the `install`/`init` global bootstrap prompt Y/n in interactive
  terminals before installing the optional external-skills and CodeGraph
  pieces (Enter keeps the default-on behavior; non-TTY and `--json` runs stay
  unprompted; explicit `--no-*` flags are honored without prompting), moved
  the skills bootstrap from `npx -y skills` to `bunx skills`, and pinned the
  CodeGraph install to `@colbymchenry/codegraph@latest`.
- Added a `frontend` task profile with a design-brief gate, intake
  prior-art/negative-scenario/canonical-term trigger rules with recorded
  acceptance evidence, and a capability/archcontext boundary bridge exposing
  a read-only `archcontext-boundaries-v1` export with export tests.
- Mechanically landed the `EXECUTION_BOUNDARY` anti-extras clause on every
  delegated runner surface, with a canonical-sentence parity test; contracts
  now project the plan's Non-scope section, and In-scope/Out-of-scope get an
  independent preflight check.

### Changed

- Renamed the dead `bun run typecheck` exit-criteria command to the real
  `bun run check:type` script across every contract template/helper-mirror
  surface; explicitly revised `sprint-contracts.md`'s exit-criteria-only
  promise to scope the new Root Cause Evidence check to `bugfix`-profile
  contracts only. Bumped the review rubric from v1 to v2 so external
  acceptance must carry its own current Reviewed Diff Fingerprint and scope
  instead of a stale one, and added a bounded P1-escalation Scope Fidelity
  rubric dimension.

### Fixed

- Worked around a bash 3.2 parser trap where a `$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)`-wrapped
  heredoc with a quoted delimiter is still scanned for quote parity: an odd
  apostrophe count inside embedded template prose broke
  `scripts/lib/project-init-lib.sh` under `bash -n`. Switched to `mktemp`
  file indirection.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- Repaired workspace-source `repo-harness install` when Bun reports a
  `DependencyLoop` by packing the source tree into `~/.repo-harness/packages/`
  and reinstalling the global CLI from that tarball.
- Added tarball smoke coverage for packaged `sprint-backlog` target-root
  resolution, so release gates exercise the installed helper path instead of
  only the source checkout.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- Fixed package-dispatched `repo-harness run workstream-sync ensure` so it can
  resolve bundled `capability-resolver.ts` and `context-contract-sync.sh`
  helpers when a downstream repo no longer vendors legacy `scripts/` wrappers.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-06-29

### Changed

- Kept downstream adopt and migration helper execution on the package/global
  runtime path through `repo-harness run`, without generating repo-local helper
  wrapper scripts.
- Refreshed the current dependency lines so `commander` and the CodeGraph dev
  dependency resolve to the latest accepted release lines.

### Fixed

- Removed the compatibility-wrapper adoption path so package-managed helpers do
  not pollute target repository `scripts/` directories.
- Added the missing packaged factor-lab helper templates so package helper
  parity matches the source `scripts/` runtime surface.
- Ignored local GPT Pro, Oracle, and MCP runtime evidence under `.ai/harness/`
  so self-host release gates do not treat operator state as source changes.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-06-29

### Changed

- Updated the repo-local CodeGraph dev dependency to `@colbymchenry/codegraph@latest`
  so self-hosted tooling checks stay on the current bundle line; the release
  lockfile resolves this to `1.1.2`.

### Fixed

- Fixed repo alias discovery for registered repo resolution so MCP/workspace
  reader flows can resolve configured repository aliases consistently.
- Reduced completed workflow artifact noise by keeping fulfilled plan,
  contract, review, notes, and runtime-evidence surfaces out of active grep and
  root workflow projections after closeout.
- Hardened plan artifact gates so `work-package` remains the only durable
  plan -> contract/review/notes projection boundary, while `checklist-row`
  work stays inside the active plan `## Task Breakdown`.
- Rejected placeholder `--promotion-reason` values before `capture-plan
  --execute` writes durable state, and blocked transient or inline sprint plans
  from being projected into contract/review/notes artifacts.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- Suppressed Codex `Stop.default` decision stdout so the Desktop app no longer
  turns one-shot planning/delegation guard output into
  `{"detail":"Unsupported content type"}` at turn finalization. Claude keeps
  the direct Stop decision JSON path.
- Skipped global runtime self-install when `repo-harness` is already running
  from Bun's global install prefix, so `repo-harness global-runtime init` does
  not try to install the package into itself.

### Removed

- Removed the experimental ChatGPT Chrome extension provider, including
  `browser-bind`, `--provider bridge`, generated extension code, and scaffolded
  `.ai/harness/chatgpt/bridge-extension/` ignore entries. Oracle remains the
  supported GPT Pro browser consult path; native is deprecated diagnostics only.

### Added

- Added the General Repo MCP reference covering tool JSON examples, repo
  administration, privacy/audit boundaries, migration from workflow-artifact
  reads, rollout flags, and known limitations.
- Added the General Repo MCP CodeGraph rollout runbook for index stale,
  CodeGraph down, incomplete manifest, mutation conflict, reindex dead-letter,
  and rollback operations.
- Added the Sprint 4 release filing for the CodeGraph general repo rollout
  module, including local and hosted verification evidence.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Added `assets/hooks/projection.json` plus `bun run sync:hooks` and
  `bun run check:hooks`, making `assets/hooks/` the canonical hook source and
  `.ai/hooks/` the generated self-host projection.
- Added Review Rubric v1 and implementation diff fingerprints to review,
  release, and peer-acceptance prompts.
- Added review freshness validation for Done claims: fresh fingerprints pass,
  legacy missing fingerprints warn, and stale or malformed fingerprints block
  closeout until `/check` and peer acceptance are refreshed.
- Added tarball and central-install parity checks so packaged hook assets and
  installed `~/.repo-harness/hooks/` copies match the canonical managed file
  set.

### Changed

- Updated hook operations and README release docs to use the generated
  self-host hook projection contract instead of manual generated/self-host
  parity edits.
- Expanded repo-pinned hook install and migration paths to copy the managed hook
  runtime file set, not only shell scripts.
- Raised the migration idempotency integration test timeout to the suite-level
  budget now that repo-pinned hook projection copies a larger managed file set.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Added advisory minimal-change hooks across `SessionStart`,
  `UserPromptSubmit`, `PostToolUse.edit`, and `Stop`, with deterministic
  `.ai/harness/checks/minimal-change.latest.json` evidence, handoff summaries,
  explicit opt-in policy, scaffold/migration adoption, and reference-config
  docs.
- Added ChatGPT MCP `workspaceReader` capability on the default `planner`
  profile, with registered-repo workspaces and `reader_status`,
  `list_allowed_roots`, `open_workspace`, `tree`, `search_text`, and
  `read_text` tools for read-only local repo access.
- Added global `~/.repo-harness/registered-repos.json` discovery for repos
  registered by `repo-harness adopt`, `repo-harness init`, or user-scope MCP
  setup, plus `repo_path` targeting for workflow reads and writers.
- Added HTTP MCP `url-token` compatibility auth mode, structured session health
  metadata, OAuth `offline_access` discovery, and refresh-token rotation that
  replaces both access and refresh tokens.

### Fixed

- Kept MCP broad-read/user-scope deny globs active for `.env`, private keys,
  SSH keys, credentials, secrets, `.git`, and dependency/build output instead
  of clearing deny rules when broad reads are enabled.
- Made legacy MCP `fullDiskRead: true` configurations fail closed instead of
  auto-migrating to `/`; users must explicitly choose registered adopted repos
  or add extra non-repo directories with `--allow-root`.

- Bound managed Codex and Claude hook adapters to the current git repository
  before dispatching user-level hooks, so global hook commands cannot
  accidentally run against a sibling repository.
- Made the hook runtime silently skip execution when an explicit
  `HOOK_REPO_ROOT` conflicts with the hook process git root.
- Stopped prompt-guard from creating or capturing repo-local plan artifacts when
  a planning prompt references a different git repository by absolute path.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Added user-scope ChatGPT MCP setup for Developer Mode deployments, storing
  local MCP config and auth under `~/.repo-harness/`; broad full-disk read is now
  deprecated in favor of registered adopted repos plus explicit `--allow-root`
  entries for extra non-repo roots.
- Added `discover_harness_repos` plus `repo_path` targeting for MCP read tools,
  so a single ChatGPT Connector can find registered adopted repos before reading
  workflow state.
- Added explicit ChatGPT app preselection for Oracle browser consults via
  `--chatgpt-app`, so GPT Pro MCP read-back prompts can select the recorded
  Connector app before submitting instead of relying on prompt text mentions.
- Added ChatGPT Connector invocation-evidence metadata to `mcp doctor`, making
  local setup readiness distinct from per-chat/model tool invocation proof.

### Fixed

- Stopped `repo-harness adopt --compact --dry-run --json` from planning retired
  root helper compatibility wrappers after helper runtime has moved to the
  user-level/package surface.
- Kept ChatGPT MCP writes scoped to workflow artifacts while widening only the
  authorized read boundary, so absolute writes and runner execution remain
  blocked under the planner profile.
- Let package-dispatched architecture helpers find their sibling
  `architecture-event` and `capability-resolver` helpers without requiring
  repo-local `scripts/*` copies.
- Kept context scans focused on active repo context by skipping local backup and
  harness archive directories, while preserving negative safety guidance such as
  `Never print credentials.`

## [0.7.3] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- Preserved imperative Codex delegation prompts whose investigation target uses
  `why` or `how`, while keeping mechanism/design questions non-authorizing.
- Scoped `SubagentStop.quality` retry state by session/run identity, subagent
  identity, and message hash so different subagents or sessions do not inherit a
  prior thin-report retry allowance.
- Kept existing ChatGPT MCP bind host and port when rerunning
  `repo-harness mcp setup chatgpt --server-name` through the real CLI.
- Made `repo-harness adopt --compact` reclaim generated root helper wrappers and
  copied helper implementations while preserving app-owned `scripts/*` files and
  rollback archives.
- Allowed strict workflow checks to pass when package-dispatched helpers replace
  repo-local root compatibility wrappers.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- Added ChatGPT native browser product-session binding for user-selected Chrome
  profiles, with printed bind-page URLs, Chrome profile-directory support,
  doctor session validation, and fail-closed native consults when no ChatGPT
  profile is bound.
- Added Oracle browser-provider heartbeat support. GPT Pro / ChatGPT browser
  consults now pass `--heartbeat`, defaulting to 59 seconds, so long-running GPT
  analysis stays observable through Cloudflare and local process boundaries.

### Fixed

- Corrected gbrain remediation guidance to install the official GitHub GBrain
  CLI instead of the unrelated npm registry `gbrain` package.
- Fail closed when native ChatGPT browser setup targets the default Chrome data
  directory, because Chrome 136+ blocks remote debugging there; doctor now
  reports `blocked_default_profile` instead of opening Chrome and timing out.
- Removed the static `file://` ChatGPT bind page path. Product-session binding
  now goes through `repo-harness chatgpt browser-bind`, whose **Bind ChatGPT**
  action calls a local authorization endpoint instead of linking directly to
  ChatGPT.
- Added the ChatGPT bridge provider for existing signed-in Chrome profiles. It
  generates a product-scoped unpacked extension for ChatGPT domains plus
  localhost, validates composer readiness through extension heartbeat, and
  supports `browser-consult --provider bridge` without copying cookies or
  browser storage.
- Hardened ChatGPT bridge authorization diagnostics for unpacked extensions
  recorded in Chrome `Secure Preferences`, and isolated bridge-provider tests
  from user-installed extensions polling the default local port.
- Excluded `gbrain` from setup readiness dependencies: missing or stale gbrain
  stays visible as advisory tooling state without creating Agent actions.
- Kept ChatGPT MCP stable endpoints out of tracked generated guides, storing
  real Connector URLs only in ignored local config while public docs remain
  placeholder-only.
- Preserved existing ChatGPT MCP endpoint, auth, transport, profile, and dev-mode
  settings when rerunning `repo-harness mcp setup chatgpt --server-name`.
- Made `repo-harness mcp doctor --profile chatgpt` report whether the ChatGPT
  server name is actually configured instead of masking missing local state with
  the default `repo-harness` name.
- Made Oracle doctor repair actions source-aware, so explicit `--oracle-bin`,
  `REPO_HARNESS_ORACLE_BIN`, and repo-local Oracle installs get actionable repair
  guidance instead of a generic global install suggestion.
- Limited SessionStart tooling update advisories to one render per cached
  report, so weekly Waza/CodeGraph update checks do not re-inject stale
  update instructions on every new agent turn.

### Release Notes

- Prepared the `repo-harness@0.7.2` patch line for npm publish, registry
  readback, clean-room install smoke, Git tag, and GitHub release creation.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Added `repo-harness-gptpro-setup` / `repo-harness:gptpro_setup` to guide
  local `gptpro_browser` browser/session setup and `gptpro_mcp` ChatGPT
  Connector MCP setup without treating ChatGPT Pro as API quota.
- Added `repo-harness-gptpro` / `repo-harness:gptpro` as the local consult
  skill for GPT Pro browser-session assistance, using `gptpro
  consult/read/continue/open` language over the existing ChatGPT Web browser
  session engine.

### Fixed

- Preserved `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json` for authoritative
  `repo-harness-run-trace.v1` evidence by writing PostBash advisory metadata to
  `.ai/harness/checks/post-bash-latest.json`.

### Release Notes

- Prepared the `repo-harness@0.7.1` patch line for npm publish, registry
  readback, clean-room `npx` smoke, Git tag, and GitHub release creation.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Added `repo-harness chatgpt browser-*`, a policy-checked ChatGPT Web browser
  session engine with dry-run prompt assembly, repo-local session records,
  linked follow-ups, output copying, session read/list/open, and dry-run-first
  cleanup.
- Added optional MCP ChatGPT browser tools behind
  `repo-harness mcp serve --enable-chatgpt-browser`, keeping browser consults
  out of the default MCP surface.
- Added an Oracle provider wrapper for `oracle --engine browser` and a native
  installed-Google-Chrome CDP provider spike for logged-in ChatGPT Web sessions.
- Added a bundled `repo-harness-chatgpt-browser` skill and user guide at
  `docs/repo-harness-chatgpt-browser-engine.md`.
- Added a hosted GitHub CI gate for pull requests and pushes to `main` /
  `codex/**`.
- Added the Harness Engineering Optimization sprint closeout surface, including
  task profiles, Human Review Card enforcement, trace/eval evidence grading,
  handoff UX, delegation contract roles, and compressed spec/onboarding paths.
- Added `repo-harness uninstall` to remove repo-harness managed Codex/Claude
  hook adapters while preserving sibling user hooks and Codex trust-state
  residue.
- Added fs-transaction manifests for `repo-harness adopt --experimental-ts-apply`
  and `repo-harness adopt rollback --transaction <manifest>` so the safe
  TypeScript applicator has an executable recovery path.
- Added `scripts/check-release-published.sh` for post-publish npm registry,
  dist-tag, tarball integrity, Git tag, and local version readback.
- Added `scripts/check-tarball-install-smoke.sh` and wired it into the CI gate
  so release checks install the packed tarball in a temporary project and start
  the packaged `repo-harness` and `repo-harness-hook` bins.

### Changed

- Made `repo-harness install` the primary first-run global runtime bootstrap
  command, while preserving `repo-harness init` as a compatibility alias and
  keeping `repo-harness install --target <host> --location <scope>` as the
  adapter-only path.

### Fixed

- Made generated ChatGPT Connector `/goal` prompts and `repo-harness-goal`
  reporting guidance language-neutral, so installed skills and MCP goal handoff
  output follow the user's language or repo-local instructions instead of
  hard-coding Chinese prompt lines.
- Made non-standard `repo-harness adopt --mode minimal|self-host` fail closed
  unless it routes to ordinary TypeScript `--dry-run` or
  `--experimental-ts-apply`,
  avoiding a mismatch where dry-run showed a TypeScript mode plan but apply
  still used the standard shell migrator.
- Made minimal TypeScript adoption install
  `.ai/harness/workflow-contract.json`, preserving the hook opt-in marker for
  all adoption modes.
- Normalized protocol v1 JSON error output for adoption target validation
  failures.
- Added safe-applicator preflight inside `applyAdoptionPlan()` so exported
  callers cannot partially write a plan before encountering an unsupported
  operation.
- Preserved CRLF `.gitignore` managed blocks without duplicate insertion and
  added planned/skipped/failed summary counts to adoption plan output.
- Added a bounded CLI process runner for init/adopt/global-runtime, CodeGraph
  setup, and `repo-harness run` helper dispatch, with default timeout, output
  cap, and common secret redaction.

### Release Notes

- Prepared the `repo-harness@0.7.0` minor release line for npm publish,
  registry readback, clean-room `npx` smoke, Git tag, and GitHub release
  creation.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Added the Transactional Adoption Planner foundation for
  `repo-harness adopt --dry-run --json`, including protocol v1 operation plans,
  redacted JSON rendering, fixture-backed planner tests, and a safe applicator
  subset for `mkdir`, `writeFile ifMissing`, and managed `.gitignore` blocks.
- Added workflow-contract manifest planning to the TypeScript adoption plan so
  `standard` and `self-host` dry-run JSON now report installation of
  `.ai/harness/workflow-contract.json` from the canonical tracked asset.
- Added workflow-contract-backed adoption templates for `docs/spec.md` and
  `tasks/current.md`, keeping their `writeFile ifMissing` planner behavior while
  moving the file body and reason out of `plan.ts`.
- Added standard-mode helper wrapper planning to the TypeScript adoption plan so
  downstream dry-run JSON reports generated `scripts/<helper>` compatibility
  wrappers from the workflow contract helper manifest.
- Added an atomic safe-applicator writer with target locks, temp-file fsync,
  parent-directory fsync, and backup metadata for existing targets.
- Routed human-readable `repo-harness adopt --dry-run` output through the
  TypeScript adoption planner text renderer, matching the JSON dry-run source of
  truth without writing repo files.
- Added `repo-harness adopt --experimental-ts-apply` as an opt-in TypeScript
  safe-applicator path, with preflight rejection for plans containing
  unsupported operations.
- Added rollback metadata to adoption operation plans so dry-run JSON and
  experimental apply reports expose the planned recovery strategy per operation.
- Added workflow-contract install support to the experimental TypeScript
  adoption applicator, including atomic replacement backups for stale manifests.
- Added workflow-contract-backed adoption templates for `tasks/todos.md` and
  `tasks/lessons.md`, completing manifest ownership of the initial bootstrap
  ledger file bodies.

### Release Notes

- Prepared the `repo-harness@0.6.0` minor release line for npm publish,
  registry readback, clean-room `npx` smoke, Git tag, and GitHub release
  creation.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- Fixed `repo-harness update --version <version>` so the update subcommand can
  install an explicit `repo-harness@<version>` package. The top-level
  `repo-harness --version` / `repo-harness -V` shortcut still prints the CLI
  version, but it no longer intercepts the update command's package-version
  option.

### Release Notes

- Prepared the `repo-harness@0.5.3` patch line for npm publish, registry
  readback, clean-room `npx` smoke, Git tag, and GitHub release creation.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- Added a weekly timestamp cache for SessionStart tooling-update advisories so
  Waza and CodeGraph update checks run at most once per week by default unless
  `REPO_HARNESS_TOOLING_ADVISORY_TTL_SECONDS` overrides the TTL.
- Added reviewed security exceptions to `repo-harness security scan` so
  user-level warning-only hook findings can be accepted through exact
  `filePath` + `ruleId` + `command` matches while high/fail findings stay
  active.
- Added transcript recovery to the bundled `claude-review` cross-review skill
  for Claude Code print-mode runs that write the final assistant message to the
  session transcript but produce empty stdout.

### Changed

- Treated `gbrain doctor --json --fast` connection warnings that only report
  skipped DB checks as an accepted fast-mode readiness state, while preserving
  real gbrain warnings such as freshness drift.
- Pinned the repo-local CodeGraph dev dependency to `1.0.1` so local-first
  readiness checks do not float across patch releases.

### Fixed

- `repo-harness setup check --target codex --check-updates --json` now reports
  a fully green setup on this machine after Waza and CodeGraph are up to date,
  reviewed user-level safety hooks are recorded, and gbrain fast-mode DB checks
  are treated as intentionally skipped.

### Release Notes

- Prepared the `repo-harness@0.5.2` package line for npm publish, registry
  readback, clean-room `npx` smoke, Git tag, and GitHub release creation.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- Fixed CodeGraph readiness detection so repo-local checks prefer the installed
  platform bundle before the npm shim. This prevents a broken `.bin/codegraph`
  shim from turning a ready local index into `project_index=unavailable`.
- Synced the same CodeGraph resolver into the generated-project helper template.

### Release Notes

- Prepared the `repo-harness@0.5.1` package line for publish; npm publish,
  registry readback, and GitHub release creation remain explicit release
  actions.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- Added README release art from `docs/images/image.png` and documented the
  install/refresh split for first-run bootstrap, user-level runtime updates,
  read-only setup audit, and repo-local adoption.
- Documented the eight managed hook routes installed by the Claude/Codex
  adapters: `SessionStart.default`, `PreToolUse.edit`,
  `PreToolUse.subagent`, `PostToolUse.edit`, `PostToolUse.bash`,
  `PostToolUse.always`, `UserPromptSubmit.default`, and `Stop.default`.

### Changed

- Breaking: `repo-harness update` now owns CLI/user-level runtime refresh only;
  use `repo-harness adopt` for repo-local workflow install, refresh, and
  migration.
- `repo-harness update --check` / `--no-runtime-refresh` now route to the
  read-only setup checklist, and third-party skill/CodeGraph refreshes require
  explicit opt-in.
- Added `repo-harness setup check` as the productized read-only readiness
  command while keeping `repo-harness init-hook` as a compatibility alias.

### Fixed

- Refused `$HOME` as a repo adoption target before any mutation and hardened
  legacy context discovery so vendored/cache trees such as `go/pkg/mod`,
  nested `node_modules`, and `vendor` are not mirrored into.

### Release Notes

- Prepared the `repo-harness@0.5.0` package line for publish; npm publish,
  registry readback, and GitHub release creation remain explicit release
  actions.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Added `repo-harness docs list|path|show` so bundled runtime/reference docs
  resolve from the user-level/package install instead of copied repo prose.
- Added `repo-harness init-hook --json` bootstrap audit guidance for working
  rules, adapter drift, stale CLI installs, and tooling readiness.
- Added first-principles edit guard coverage to the managed hook route set as
  advisory anti-overengineering guidance.

### Changed

- Generated and migrated repos now write deterministic
  `docs/reference-configs/*.md` pointer stubs while keeping `.ai/harness/*` and
  `.ai/context/*` as repo-local runtime artifacts.
- Retired `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` from the reference-doc asset surface and
  stopped publishing duplicate `docs/reference-configs/` runtime docs in the
  npm package file list.

### Fixed

- Clarified plan-completeness capture wording so release/readiness checks do
  not mistake a Draft scan plan for executable implementation state.
- Made `scripts/check-npm-release.sh` refresh the current handoff before the
  Codex resume packet so the release gate works from a clean checkout without
  ignored runtime handoff files.

### Release Notes

- Prepared the `repo-harness@0.4.3` package line for publish; npm publish,
  registry readback, and GitHub release creation remain explicit release
  actions.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Added the `repo-harness-prd` command facade, PRD template, and PRD eval
  fixtures for generating upper-layer PRDs under `plans/prds/`.
- Added a subagent return-channel guard to the managed Claude/Codex hook routes
  so delegated runs are nudged back through the parent session instead of
  leaking completion claims through the wrong channel.

### Changed

- Split upper-layer PRDs from Sprint backlogs: PRDs stay in `plans/prds/`,
  Sprint backlogs move to `plans/sprints/*.sprint.md`, and `repo-harness-sprint`
  now supports PRD-to-Sprint planning without re-deciding product intent.
- Isolated generated-project helper implementations under `.ai/harness/scripts/`
  while keeping `scripts/*` as compatibility command wrappers.
- Updated skill eval 24 and added evals for PRD generation and PRD-to-Sprint
  backlog creation so the public command surface covers the new hierarchy.
- Aligned the `repo-harness-prd` command guidance with the installed
  `.ai/harness/scripts/check-task-workflow.sh` runtime path.

### Release Notes

- Prepared the `repo-harness@0.4.2` package line for publish; npm publish,
  registry readback, and GitHub release creation remain explicit release
  actions.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- Scoped the CodeGraph route nudge to the real hook stdin `session_id` by
  exporting `HOOK_SESSION_ID` from the shared hook input parser and preferring
  it in `session_state_resolve_key`. CodeGraph one-shot state is now per
  Claude/Codex session instead of being pinned to a stale `.claude/.session-id`
  fallback.
- Prevented stale repo-local hook scripts from racing user-level host adapters:
  generated and migrated repos now prune top-level `.ai/hooks/*.sh` unless
  `.ai/harness/policy.json` explicitly pins `"hook_source": "repo"`.
- Treated a missing `post-tool-observer.sh` on `PostToolUse.always` as a
  soft-missing advisory route with an update hint, instead of hard-failing the
  hook runtime when a copied repo-local hook set is stale.

### Changed

- Kept non-pinned downstream repos on the user-level hook runtime by retaining
  only `.ai/hooks/lib/` helper fallbacks plus a README tombstone; this self-host
  repo can still pin live hook development to `.ai/hooks`.
- Normalized active workflow documentation to `tasks/todos.md` for the deferred
  ledger and topic-scoped `docs/researches/*.md` for durable research reports.
- Added `tasks/.current.md.tmp.*` and `.claude/.plan-state/` to the managed
  runtime ignore block, and gave plain `bun test` the same 60s per-test timeout
  used by the release gate.

### Release Notes

- Prepared the `repo-harness@0.4.1` package line for publish; npm publish,
  registry readback, and GitHub release creation remain explicit release
  actions.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Added a loop-engine evidence surface: `repo-harness-hook state-snapshot
  --json`, an NL decision-table reference, route NL-vs-TS benchmark fixtures,
  and a cutover gate that keeps TypeScript routing authoritative unless
  measured evidence passes.
- Added `scripts/architecture-queue.sh` plus
  `scripts/check-architecture-sync.sh` for derived architecture request indexes,
  stale-index detection, and strict/advisory finish gates.
- Added contract delegation metadata (`budget`, `permission_scope`, and
  `roles`) to contract templates and generated workflow contracts.
- Added `scripts/contract-run.ts`, a repo-local pilot runner that executes
  explicit worker/verifier child commands and validates the verifier output
  against contract exit criteria.
- Added `scripts/heartbeat-triage.sh` and the `.ai/harness/triage/` surface for
  scheduled workflow, sprint-next, and architecture-request triage.

### Changed

- Productized architecture queue assets into both self-host scripts and
  generated-repo templates, including workflow contract inventory, reference
  docs, migration handling, and scaffold parity tests.
- Updated session-start/current-status projection and task workflow checks to
  account for archived sprint plans, archived notes, contract delegation fields,
  and the completed loop-engine sprint.
- Retired the separate generated workflow compatibility `5.x` line; package,
  skill, and template stamps now share the `repo-harness@0.4.0` release line.
- Added `check:architecture-sync` to the npm scripts and release verification
  surface.

### Removed

- Retired `scripts/architecture-drift.sh` and its helper-template copy in favor
  of `architecture-queue.sh`; migrations remove legacy copies from downstream
  repos.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Added the sprint program layer: `plans/sprints/`, sprint templates,
  `scripts/sprint-backlog.sh`, the `repo-harness-sprint` command facade, active
  sprint markers, current-status projection, session-start projection, workflow
  validation, and generated-repo parity copies.
- Added `src/cli/hook/prompt-intents.ts`: every prompt-text intent classifier
  now lives in TypeScript with real Unicode semantics, fixing
  locale-dependent Chinese misclassification (UTF-8 continuation bytes
  matching `[[:punct:]]` under `LC_ALL=C` grep, e.g. "实现会在这个 worktree
  里完成。" misread as a done declaration on GNU grep).
- Added an edit-layer plan gate to `pre-edit-guard.sh`: implementation edits
  (paths outside plans/tasks/docs/deploy/harness/markdown surfaces) block
  unless the active plan is Approved/Executing and `docs/spec.md` exists.
  Modes `enforce` (default) | `advice` | `off` via policy
  `.guards.edit_plan_gate` or `REPO_HARNESS_EDIT_PLAN_GATE`.
- Added the `prompt-guard-decide` prompt protocol: the shell hook pipes
  `{"prompt": ...}` on stdin and receives one verdict JSON line (action,
  intent facts, derived strings). Legacy copied hooks that send env facts
  still receive the bare action enum.

### Changed

- Hook runtime resolution is now central-first: user-level adapters dispatch
  into `repo-harness-hook`, central packaged hooks are the default runtime, and
  repo policy can pin self-host development back to the repo copy without
  changing downstream user adapters.
- Prompt-layer plan/spec/contract gates became advisory routing; hard
  enforcement moved to the PreToolUse edit layer where it keys off path +
  plan state instead of natural-language guessing. Done-claim gates keep
  blocking because they verify file-backed completion evidence.
- Merged the PostToolUse always-route observers (`trace-event.sh` +
  `context-pressure-hook.sh`) into one `post-tool-observer.sh`: one dispatch,
  one stdin parse, and one library load per tool call. `.claude/.trace.jsonl`
  is now the single tool-trace record (handoff "Commands Run" reads it
  directly), and context-budget bun probes are sampled every 5th call. The
  route tuple (PostToolUse, always) is unchanged; a workflow-contract
  upgrade entry prunes the retired split hooks from migrated repos.
- Unified `run-hook.sh`'s two Codex stdout-filter branches into one
  parameterized path.

### Removed

- Removed the duplicated shell fallback decision table from
  `prompt-guard.sh` (the 0.2.4 copied-hook fallback). Without a reachable
  TypeScript engine the prompt layer now degrades to a one-shot advisory and
  defers enforcement to the edit layer.
- Removed the orphan `scripts/check-versions.ts` and its test, and the
  hidden `prompt-guard-decision` CLI alias (use `prompt-guard-decide`).
- Retired the `project-initializer` legacy name, `PROJECT_INITIALIZER_*`
  environment fallbacks, and the `repo-harness-skill` compatibility alias;
  installed-copy sync now deletes both retired skill directories.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- Added shell fallback routing for copied prompt hooks when the TypeScript
  decision engine is unavailable, preserving PlanCaptureGate guidance instead
  of failing closed on installed hook copies.
- Added workflow readiness checks for stale handoff/resume plan references and
  action-command skill quality gates.
- Added benchmark quality metrics so release evidence distinguishes
  authoritative non-dry-run skill evals from dry-run smoke output.

### Fixed

- Treated plan/workflow consultation prompts as advisory text instead of
  sending them into `PlanStatusGuard`, so questions that mention `new plan`,
  `方案`, hooks, or workflow routing no longer create plan files or block with
  "No active plan found" unless they explicitly start execution.

### Changed

- Updated the self-host CodeGraph development dependency to `0.9.9` and made
  gbrain readiness probe `doctor --json --fast` before falling back to the full
  doctor command.
- Updated maintainer release docs and README verification guidance to require
  non-dry-run skill eval evidence when claiming skill effectiveness.
- Refreshed the ignored Codex resume packet inside the npm release gate before
  strict workflow validation, so release tests that update handoff runtime state
  cannot leave the gate failing its own stale-resume invariant.

### Removed

- Retired the self-host-only `autoresearch-advisory.sh` hook from `.ai/hooks`,
  the generated hook adapter installer, and hook parity exceptions. Autoresearch
  now stays an explicit agent-run workflow instead of a user-level background
  hook route.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-05

### Changed

- Replaced the public `repo-harness init` path with a typed global bootstrap
  that installs the current package as the global CLI, refreshes repo-harness
  skill aliases, installs user-level hook adapters, configures Waza
  `think`/`hunt`/`check`/`health`, persists the brain root, and configures
  CodeGraph MCP without applying repo-local workflow files to the current
  directory.

### Removed

- Removed the Superpowers Claude marketplace installer path entirely from the
  active `repo-harness init` flow and from `scripts/setup-plugins.sh`.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- Streamed `repo-harness init` setup output directly to the terminal so the
  first-run `npx -y repo-harness init` path no longer looks hung while
  `setup-plugins.sh` clones skills or runs Claude plugin setup.
- Made the Superpowers Claude marketplace plugin opt-in via
  `repo-harness init --with-superpowers` instead of installing it by default.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added `repo-harness init` as a thin npm CLI wrapper around
  `scripts/setup-plugins.sh`, so users can run
  `npx -y repo-harness init` for first-run global Claude plugin and hook-profile
  bootstrap without cloning the source repository.
- Added a prompt-guard CodeGraph self-heal path: before emitting the first
  structural code-navigation hint in a session, a missing `.codegraph` index is
  initialized with the local or PATH-visible CodeGraph binary without running the
  heavier readiness probe.

### Changed

- Moved the existing repo-local harness install/refresh CLI surface to
  `repo-harness update`, keeping `repo-harness init` focused on global runtime
  initialization.
- Updated the English, Chinese, Japanese, French, and Spanish READMEs for the
  `0.2.1` npm release line and the split `init` / `update` lifecycle.

### Fixed

- Kept automatic hook-side CodeGraph initialization non-blocking and cleaned up
  the Cursor rule file if current CodeGraph created it only as a side effect of
  this automatic init.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added a read-only config security scan (`repo-harness security scan [--json]`) that checks high-value hook and editor-task config (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/hooks.json`, repo-local `.vscode/tasks.json`, and legacy project-level `.claude`/`.codex` adapters) for suspicious command patterns — remote-shell pipes, base64-decode-to-exec, `osascript`, `launchctl`/`crontab` persistence, netcat, and inline interpreter execution — plus unmanaged hook commands and auto-run `folderOpen` tasks. It reports findings only and never mutates config.
- Added a low-frequency `SessionStart` sentinel (`.ai/hooks/security-sentinel.sh`, wired into the `SessionStart.default` route) that fingerprints the config set and re-scans only when a fingerprint changes, surfacing a one-line `[SecurityConfig]` reminder when findings appear.
- Added a `security-config` check to `repo-harness doctor` backed by the same read-only scan.

### Changed

- Bumped the npm package release line from `0.1.5` to `0.2.0`; generated workflow compatibility stays on the `5.2.3` model line, and `repo-harness --version` / `repo-harness status` now report `0.2.0`.
- Added `Why repo-harness` and `What's New in 0.2.0` sections to the English, Chinese, Japanese, French, and Spanish READMEs, promoting file-backed cross-session coordination, CodeGraph-plus-progressive-context token savings, the `scripts/setup-plugins.sh` installer, the config security sentinel, and the Claude/Codex draft-plan lifecycle.
- Added the README hero image to the npm package allowlist so package consumers get the same visual surface as the source checkout.
- Fixed the Chinese README, which still referenced `0.1.4`, to track the current release version.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- Added `REPO_HARNESS_*` environment variable aliases for scaffold, migration, context-block selection, external-tooling checks, and contract-worktree controls while preserving `PROJECT_INITIALIZER_*` as legacy fallbacks.
- Switched new runtime `.gitignore` and Codex resume generated markers to `repo-harness` while keeping dual-read compatibility for legacy `project-initializer` markers.
- Added a dirty merged linked-worktree closeout guard to `ship-worktrees.sh --cleanup-merged`, requiring useful deltas to be committed, picked, or applied before cleanup and allowing only explicit scaffold-only discard.
- Made `prepare-codex-handoff.sh` prefer Node for global handoff file updates, with Python retained as a fallback, so release verification does not depend on the local `python3 -` execution path.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

- Switched generated plan task artifacts from slug-only names to the active plan stem (`YYYYMMDD-HHMM-<slug>`) for `tasks/contracts/`, `tasks/reviews/`, and `tasks/notes/`.

### Fixed

- Kept workflow-state, handoff, archive, and contract-worktree helpers compatible with existing slug-only task artifacts while preferring the new plan-stem paths.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Added AI-native scaffold profiles as overlays on the existing A-K plan catalog, including runtime-console, product-copilot, and sidecar-kernel project structures without introducing new public plan codes.
- Added AI-native template variables so selected profiles can project focused project structures, runtime-console defaults, and tech-stack guidance while ordinary A-K scaffolds stay unchanged.
- Added a typed prompt-guard decision engine behind `repo-harness-hook prompt-guard-decide`, keeping host adapters stable while making `intent x plan state` routing table-driven and testable.
- Added CLI and route-level regression coverage for the internal prompt-guard decision command, the lightweight hook entrypoint, and the public `UserPromptSubmit --route default` path through real hook assets.
- Added an optional deploy SQL invariant coverage check: when `tests/sql/control_plane_invariants.sql` exists, `check-deploy-sql-order.sh` now verifies every `deploy/sql/*.sql` migration is referenced by full path or basename.
- Added a dated release filing under `deploy/release-checklists/260531-repo-harness-0.1.3.md` and documented the `YYMMDD-<package>-<version>.md` filing rule.

### Changed

- Split prompt-guard responsibilities so shell continues to parse hook JSON, read workflow files, perform capture side effects, and render host-safe output while TypeScript owns the explicit decision table.
- Documented the 0.1.x release surface as `repo-harness@0.1.3`, still separate from the generated workflow compatibility line (`5.2.3`).
- Expanded the English and Chinese README plus the hook operations reference to show the current host adapter -> CLI route registry -> shell hook -> TypeScript decision table architecture.

### Fixed

- Routed active Draft plan prompts such as `implement this plan` and `执行这个方案` to the non-blocking PlanCaptureGate instead of hard-blocking under PlanStatusGuard.
- Routed no-active-plan and Approved-plan execution projection prompts through the appropriate capture/projection advice instead of collapsing them into generic PlanStatusGuard or ContractGuard failures.
- Treated copied worktree status, retrospective completion reports, and next-slice planning summaries as passive context so they do not start implementation gates merely because they quote implementation vocabulary.
- Ensured linked contract worktrees include `.ai/harness/planning/` before pending orchestration cleanup, preserving strict workflow verification in generated worktrees.
- Filtered `tasks/.current.md.tmp.*` refresh scratch files out of generated `tasks/current.md` snapshots, including generated repo helper parity.
- Aligned `repo-harness --version` and `repo-harness status` with the `package.json` release version for `0.1.3`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- Added `repo-harness init` as a one-shot existing-repo bootstrap that defaults `--repo` to the current working directory, refreshes host adapters, applies the harness, installs Waza runtime skills, syncs `diagram-design`, and verifies the repo-local workflow.
- Added `repo-harness init --no-codegraph` and `--configure-codegraph` so existing-repo bootstrap can either skip CodeGraph readiness or explicitly register CodeGraph MCP after building the index.
- Added `check:release` / `prepublishOnly` npm release gates that check the official npm registry and reject already-published package versions before running tests, workflow checks, migration dry-run, and pack dry-run.
- Added a GitHub-facing bilingual README path with `README.zh-CN.md` and a Mermaid task workflow from plan to contract worktree checkout, guarded implementation, verification, review, external acceptance, finish, merge, and cleanup.

### Changed

- Retired `project-initializer` as a Codex/Claude installed skill path and upstream resolver fallback; installed-copy sync now removes those directories instead of maintaining them.
- Switched generated footer stamps to `repo-harness@...` while keeping `.claude/.skill-version` semantic version fields stable.
- Prepared npm publishing under the unscoped `repo-harness` package name, made `repo-harness` the primary installed command, and kept `repo-harness-skill` as a compatibility alias.
- Split the npm/CLI package release line (`0.1.x`) from the generated workflow compatibility line (`5.2.3`).
- Updated GitHub repository metadata and source checkout docs for the `Ancienttwo/repo-harness` rename.
- Forced copy-based installed-skill sync when `repo-harness init` runs from an npm `_npx` cache source, avoiding symlinks to temporary npx cache directories.
- Clarified the product boundary, three-layer operating model, and task lifecycle on the README landing page.

### Fixed

- Rebuilt Claude skill aliases during installed-copy sync so `~/.claude/skills/project-initializer` cannot remain on a stale legacy repo while Codex runtime aliases are current.
- Reduced full-suite release flakiness by giving `doctor` environment-probe tests a wider timeout budget.

## [5.2.3] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Expanded anchored approval intent variants such as `go ahead with it`, `please proceed`, and `可以干了` so post-plan approvals reach `PlanCaptureGate` / `PlanExecutionGate` without treating broad bug-fix wording as approval capture.

## [5.2.2] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Started a Draft `plans/` artifact as soon as explicit Codex Plan mode or Waza `/think` planning begins, so plan lifecycle state exists before approval and execution gates run.
- Let terse approval prompts such as `GO` and `可以干` reach the approved-plan capture/projection path instead of being blocked before the agent can run `capture-plan.sh` or `plan-to-todo.sh`.

## [5.2.1] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Fixed terse `GO` approval prompts after Codex Plan mode or Waza `/think` so they trigger `PlanStatusGuard` and route execution through captured `plans/` artifacts instead of bypassing the workflow gate.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- Added passive plan capture so Codex Plan mode, Waza `/think`, and `repo-harness-plan` outputs can become file-backed `plans/plan-*.md` artifacts through `scripts/capture-plan.sh`, with approved captures able to project directly through `plan-to-todo.sh`.
- Added opt-in default-brain document mirroring through `scripts/sync-brain-docs.sh`, manifest `sync.direction=repo-to-brain` entries, and PostEdit hook integration for registered valuable docs.
- Promoted CodeGraph from advisory setup guidance to required Codex agent readiness for code navigation, with read-only detector support, strict readiness checks, generated repo `.codegraph/` ignores, and non-vendored host install guidance.

## [5.1.2] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Added generated Codex hook adapter support through `.codex/hooks.json` while keeping `.ai/hooks/` as the shared hook implementation layer.
- Updated init, scaffold, migration, workflow contract, docs, and tests so generated repos install both Claude and Codex hook adapters.

## [5.1.1] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Refreshed stale `references/` docs for the current `repo-harness` hook, migration, eval, plugin, and minimal-documentation contracts.
- Updated public-surface spec and architecture docs to reflect the full 13-command `agentic-dev-*` facade inventory.
- Removed empty optional doc placeholders so generated/self-hosted docs match the `minimal-agentic` profile.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Added filesystem-owned Evidence Contract fields and guards so approved plan execution must name state/progress path, verification evidence, evaluator rubric, stop condition, and rollback surface before implementation or completion.

### Changed

- Made broad research delegation a main-agent spawn decision based on context impact and callable runners, with bounded main-thread fallback when spawning is not useful or available.
- Hardened Waza external-tooling checks to compare whole skill directories and shared `rules/` files instead of only `SKILL.md`, catching broken `references/`, `scripts/`, `agents/`, and cross-skill rule links.

## [5.0.2] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- Excluded ignored repo-local runtime state from Codex installed-copy sync outputs.

## [5.0.1] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Added the repo-harness plugin architecture map, domain/module docs, and capability-indexed local context contracts for Claude and Codex.

### Fixed

- Fixed Codex installed-copy sync for symlinked legacy `project-initializer` fallback paths.
- Removed tracked Claude trace state from the release surface and ignored repo-local Codex/runtime logs.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- Made repeated `migrate-project-template.sh --apply` idempotent after a clean migration commit by normalizing first-write JSON output and preserving unchanged version stamps.
- Removed stale `3.1 guidance` wording from migration dry-run output.

### Changed

- Added `deploy/sql/` as the tracked deployment SQL surface and wired a filename-order check for `0001_name.sql` style files.
- Split deployable operations assets into tracked `deploy/` while keeping `_ops/` fully ignored for local private operations state and secrets.
- Externalized long-form optional reference configs into the default brain file vault while keeping repo-local runtime contracts, hooks, scripts, and required minimal docs authoritative.
- Added a repo-local brain manifest and workflow check for default brain pointers without making hooks depend on gbrain or iCloud.
- Renamed the skill/package/repo display surface to `repo-harness` while keeping `repo-harness-skill` and `project-initializer` as legacy aliases, install paths, and generated stamp compatibility surfaces.
- Added action-style `agentic-dev-*` command skill facades for plan, review, autoplan, init, scaffold, migrate, upgrade, repair, and check while keeping hooks/docs initialization internal.
- Added advisory prompt-hook route hints for reusable-workflow packaging, with `repo-harness-autoplan` handling evidence-first plans only after user authorization.
- Added a Codex installed-copy sync helper that keeps command facades only in the canonical `repo-harness` copy while legacy directories remain runtime fallback bundles.

## [4.0.2] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- Installed `inspect-project-state.ts`, `migrate-workflow-docs.ts`, `workflow-contract.ts`, `check-skill-version.ts`, and a delegating `migrate-project-template.sh` wrapper into generated repos so the router verification path is not left stale.
- Made generated capability discovery ignore `.worktrees/` and `_ref/` caches, preventing local worktree contracts from polluting `.ai/context/capabilities.json`.

## [4.0.1] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Added a versioned upgrade strategy to the workflow contract, inspector output, harness policy, and migration cleanup path so legacy reconfiguration, archives, preserves, and removals are auditable.
- Added `docs/reference-configs/global-working-rules.md` as the user-level Claude/Codex rule template with enforceable P1/P2/P3 due diligence.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-05-20

### Changed

- Removed `docs/PROGRESS.md` from default generated and required workflow surfaces; legacy progress files are now archived during migration instead of normalized in place.
- Replaced default root `specs/` scaffolding with `docs/spec.md`, `interfaces/`, and tests as the stable product/runtime truth surfaces.
- Promoted `_ops/` as the trackable operations workspace for runbooks, submission materials, release checklists, and helper scripts, while keeping `_ops/secrets/` and `_ops/env/.env*` ignored.
- Made `_ref/` an ignored external comparison cache and added hook guards that block product edits under `_ref/` and sensitive `_ops` env/secret paths.
- Updated workflow contracts, generated templates, reference docs, architecture index, and tests to use `tasks/workstreams/` for durable progress and `docs/CHANGELOG.md` for release history.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- Added `minimal-agentic` documentation generation so default scaffolds keep only required docs plus a small reference-config set, with `PROJECT_INITIALIZER_DOCUMENTATION_PROFILE=full` preserving the previous full docs surface.
- Added `docs/reference-configs/document-generation.md` to document required docs, on-demand docs, and the Agent-owned decision boundary.
- Added `lsp_profiles` metadata to policy and context maps so selected functional blocks can carry lightweight tooling hints without expanding root prompt context.
- Added `worktree_strategy` policy for conflict-triggered `codex/<task-slug>` worktrees, Waza `/check`-style validation, and merge-back to `main` without absorbing unrelated dirty changes.
- Added implementation notes as a task-local workflow artifact under `tasks/notes/`, with plan, contract, review, handoff, and archive integration.
- Added raw verification run snapshots under `.ai/harness/runs/` so `checks/latest.json` remains a pointer while durable evidence stays inspectable.

### Changed

- Updated scaffold, migration, init, ensure, workflow contract, and tests to install reference configs through the documentation profile instead of copying every reference doc by default.
- Changed init/migration external-tooling reports to skip update checks by default; set `PROJECT_INITIALIZER_CHECK_TOOLING_UPDATES=1` when an advisory run should also check upstream versions.
- Updated harness policy and reference docs to distinguish notes, evidence, promoted assets, and advisory memory instead of collapsing task-local decisions into long-term memory.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added machine-readable `agentic_development` routing so product discovery uses gstack `office-hours`, complex engineering plans use gstack `plan-eng-review`, design plans use gstack `plan-design-review`, and daily small/medium work uses Waza `/think`, `/hunt`, and `/check`.
- Added `docs/reference-configs/agentic-development-flow.md` to keep detailed gstack/Waza routing and P1/P2/P3 due-diligence triggers out of root prompts.
- Added plan and review template sections for selected route, routing reason, and P1/P2/P3 evidence.
- Added `scripts/select-agent-context-blocks.sh` as the functional-block selector hook for paired `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` generation, so Claude Code and Codex receive the same local module contract without inferring boundaries from broad layout globs.

### Changed

- Stopped generating repo-local `.claude/hooks/` shim scripts by default; `.ai/hooks/` is now the shared hook implementation layer and `.claude/settings.json` is the Claude adapter.
- Updated scaffold, migration, workflow contract, policy defaults, reference configs, and tests to keep self-host and generated repos aligned.
- Hardened workflow verification and legacy task migration around runtime contract parsing and partially migrated `tasks/todo.md` files.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- Added Codex-first Waza policy metadata to the harness contract and generated repo policy defaults.
- Added host-aware Waza detection for real Claude/Codex skill paths, per-skill versions, symlink targets, staging drift, and upstream stale status.
- Added tests covering Claude staging symlinks, Codex independent runtime copies, read-only update checks, and Codex stale drift reporting.

### Changed

- Changed Waza `--check-updates` handling to compare upstream `tw93/Waza` raw `SKILL.md` hashes without running mutating `npx skills check`.
- Documented the Waza stage -> copy into Codex -> `cmp` verification workflow for generated and self-hosted harnesses.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-04-19

### Changed

- Removed repo-local Skill Factory and Claude auto-memory surfaces from the shared harness, migration path, and self-hosted repo.
- Added `scripts/check-agent-tooling.sh` plus generated `docs/reference-configs/external-tooling.md` so init and migrate flows can report gstack, Waza, and gbrain advisory status safely.
- Merged guidance-only `external_tooling` defaults into `.ai/harness/policy.json` during scaffold and migration without overwriting explicit repo overrides.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- Added progressive context and harness policy surfaces alongside the workflow contract manifest so generated repos keep root context stable while exposing deeper context on demand.
- Wrote directory-level `AGENTS.md` files to discoverable module paths like `apps/*/AGENTS.md` instead of the container roots.
- Stopped custom plan `K` from creating `apps/`, `packages/`, and `services/` unless the target repo already has real module directories there.
- Corrected `scripts/inspect-project-state.ts` routing so initialized repos with bundled Skill Factory assets still classify as `audit` instead of collapsing to `skill-factory`.
- Tightened `scripts/check-task-workflow.sh` so strict workflow verification now fails explicitly when no `node`, `bun`, or `python3` runtime is available to read the workflow contract.
- Extended `scripts/migrate-workflow-docs.ts` to normalize legacy `tasks/todo.md` content in partially migrated repos and preserve the prior checklist in `tasks/archive/legacy-tasks-todo.md`.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-04-08

### Changed

- Added `assets/workflow-contract.v1.json` as the single machine-readable workflow contract and installed `.ai/harness/workflow-contract.json` in generated and self-hosted repos.
- Introduced `scripts/inspect-project-state.ts` so routing starts from structured repo inspection instead of prompt-only branching.
- Added `scripts/migrate-workflow-docs.ts` to preserve and migrate legacy `docs/plan.md`, `docs/TODO.md`, and execution-log style `docs/PROGRESS.md`.
- Updated migration, scaffold, and workflow verification paths to consume the shared contract manifest and verify it after migration.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-29

### Changed

- Added `run_id` to trace events, verification reports, and task-state snapshots for tighter report correlation.
- Expanded harness defaults to five dimensions by adding recovery and state profiles to the initializer question pack and plan map.
- Added structured `failure_class` logging plus `scripts/summarize-failures.sh` for guard failure aggregation.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-25

### Changed

- Upgraded generated repositories from a tasks-first scaffold to a shared long-running harness model.
- Added `docs/spec.md`, `tasks/reviews/`, and `.ai/harness/{checks,handoff}` as first-class generated artifacts.
- Reworked hook behavior around artifact-aware execution gates, contract scope enforcement, structured checks, and mandatory handoff generation.
- Upgraded the initializer question pack to `v2` and added stack-aware orchestration, evaluation, and handoff defaults.
- Updated helper scripts, templates, CLAUDE/AGENTS routing output, and tests to the shared harness model.
