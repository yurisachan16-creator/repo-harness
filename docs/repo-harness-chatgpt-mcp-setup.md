# repo-harness ChatGPT MCP Connector Setup

## Prerequisites

- At least one repo-harness adopted repository. New `repo-harness init`
  and ChatGPT setup register adopted repos in
  `~/.repo-harness/registered-repos.json`.
- A local `repo-harness` CLI on PATH.
- ChatGPT workspace access to Developer Mode and custom MCP Connectors.
- A stable public HTTPS `/mcp` endpoint for recurring ChatGPT Connector use. Local Codex can use stdio without a tunnel.

## Start Local MCP Server

Standard users run one MCP server and configure one ChatGPT Connector URL:

```bash
repo-harness mcp serve --repo . --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765 --profile planner
```

The ChatGPT Connector registers the HTTPS endpoint, not a per-repo URL. The
server discovers target repos from the global registry, so any repo registered by
`repo-harness init` or MCP setup can be
selected by passing `repo_path` to workflow tools. The `--repo` value is only
the default repo/bootstrap context, not the only usable project.

MCP config, auth, and the registered repo index have one storage authority:
`~/.repo-harness/` (override the root with `REPO_HARNESS_HOME`). Nothing is
written into a repo working tree. Extra non-repo document roots are optional and
require explicit `--allow-root`:

```bash
repo-harness mcp setup chatgpt --repo . --endpoint <https-url>/mcp
repo-harness mcp serve --repo . --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765 --profile planner
```

Optional external non-repo reader roots stay in the same Connector and must be
explicitly authorized:

```bash
repo-harness mcp setup chatgpt \
  --repo . \
  --enable-reader \
  --allow-root "$HOME/Documents" \
  --allow-root "$HOME/Projects" \
  --endpoint <https-url>/mcp
```

Direct coding is a separate, default-off profile. It requires an explicit
read-write repo grant:

```bash
repo-harness mcp setup chatgpt --profile coding --grant-read-write "$HOME/Projects/my-repo" --endpoint https://mcp.example.com/mcp
repo-harness mcp serve --repo "$HOME/Projects/my-repo" --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765 --profile coding
```

It exposes `open_workspace`, `read`, `apply_patch`, `exec_command`, and
`write_stdin`. Bash has local-user authority and is not a filesystem sandbox.
The repo grant selects which workspace can be opened; shell commands can access
anything the local OS user can access on the machine, including outside that repo.
It does not call local Codex or consume Codex quota. Read
`docs/reference-configs/chatgpt-coding-mcp.md` before enabling it.

## Migrate From Retired Repo-Scope Storage

Older repo-harness versions could store MCP config and credentials in
`<repo>/.repo-harness/`. That scope is retired. MCP commands fail closed while
`<repo>/.repo-harness/mcp.local.json` still exists. Migrate once per repo:

```bash
repo-harness mcp migrate-scope --repo .
```

The migration merges non-secret config fields into `~/.repo-harness/mcp.local.json`,
rotates the bearer token and OAuth passphrase instead of relocating them, deletes
the repo-scope OAuth token store, and removes the legacy files. ChatGPT must
re-authorize once afterwards. Re-running on a migrated repo reports nothing to do.

Health check:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/health
```

The ChatGPT path uses OAuth with a local passphrase. The passphrase is stored outside every repo, under the user-level MCP storage root:

```bash
jq -r .passphrase ~/.repo-harness/mcp.oauth.json
```

Do not commit or paste this passphrase into issue trackers, PRs, or shared logs.

OAuth discovery smoke:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp
```

## Choose Tunnel Endpoint

Keep the four network values distinct:

| Value | Example |
|---|---|
| Local origin | `http://127.0.0.1:8765` |
| Tunnel upstream | `http://127.0.0.1:8765` |
| Public origin | `https://mcp.example.com` (no `/mcp`) |
| ChatGPT MCP server URL | `https://mcp.example.com/mcp` |

For recurring ChatGPT Connector use, prefer a stable hostname from a named tunnel or reserved domain. Quick tunnels are useful for one-off smoke tests, but their URL changes and ChatGPT will treat the new URL as a different Connector app.

Stable Cloudflare named tunnel shape:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
cloudflared tunnel create repo-harness-mcp
cloudflared tunnel route dns repo-harness-mcp repo-harness-mcp.example.com
cloudflared tunnel run repo-harness-mcp
```

Then regenerate this guide with the stable endpoint:

```bash
repo-harness mcp setup chatgpt --repo . --endpoint <https-url>/mcp
```

The endpoint is stored in ignored local config. The tracked guide stays placeholder-only so real operator domains do not enter source control.

One-off quick tunnel smoke:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

| Provider | Intended use |
|---|---|
| Cloudflare named tunnel | Preferred recurring path with stable hostname |
| Cloudflare quick tunnel | One-off smoke only; URL changes |
| ngrok reserved domain | Stable debugging path with provider plan limits |
| Pinggy | Low-setup temporary smoke |
| Tailscale Funnel | Tailnet identity/ACL environments |

Use this Connector URL:

```text
<https-tunnel-url>/mcp
```

## Create ChatGPT Developer-mode App / Connector

1. Open ChatGPT **Settings → Security and login** and enable Developer mode.
2. Open **Settings → Plugins** and create a developer-mode app (older UI/material may call it a Connector).
3. Use the server name recorded in `~/.repo-harness/mcp.local.json` under `chatgpt.serverName` (new setup records the default `repo-harness` unless `--server-name` is provided).
4. Provide a description and paste the public MCP server URL ending in `/mcp`.
5. Configure Connector authentication as OAuth when prompted.
6. Create/Scan the app and verify the advertised tools.
8. When the authorization page opens, enter the passphrase from `~/.repo-harness/mcp.oauth.json`.
9. Wait for the tool scan to finish, then create the Connector.
10. Keep a permission level that asks before changes; coding tools are destructive and shell is open-world.

After changing repo-harness versions or any MCP tool schema, restart
`repo-harness mcp serve`, rescan the Connector tools, and start a fresh ChatGPT
chat. If ChatGPT keeps an old schema, delete and recreate the App/Connector.

If `repo-harness mcp doctor --repo . --json` reports `chatgpt.serverNameConfigured:false`, rerun setup with `--server-name <connector-name>` before using GPT Pro MCP read-back prompts.

## Human Workflow

Use ChatGPT for planning and review. Use Codex for local execution.

1. Use the single configured Connector for workflow planning and repo tools.
2. Call `discover_harness_repos` to list registered adopted repos, or pass `query`/`name`/`repo_path` for repo-like user text such as `my-app/`; then pass the selected exact `repo_path` when targeting a specific project. Registered repo aliases are resolved through the same authorized discovery surface, not by widening filesystem access.
3. For registered repo document/code reading, capture the `repo_id` from `discover_harness_repos`, then use `get_repo_capabilities`, `repo_manifest`, `list_tree`, `stat_file`, `read_file`, `read_files`, and `search_text`.
4. For registered repo writes, first check `get_repo_capabilities.write_tools`; mutation tools execute only for a repo registered with `accessMode: "read_write"`.
5. Ask ChatGPT to turn the idea into a PRD with `write_prd_from_idea`.
6. Ask ChatGPT to turn the PRD into a checklist Sprint with `write_checklist_sprint`.
7. Ask ChatGPT to prepare a Codex Goal with `prepare_codex_goal_from_sprint`.
8. Open Codex locally and run the generated `/goal` prompt.
9. Let Codex execute one Sprint task card at a time, run checks, update the checklist, and stage each completed phase before continuing.

Planner remains a workflow sidecar rather than a remote coding agent. Only the
separate, explicitly granted coding profile provides direct coding and shell.

## General Repo Reader Reference

The general repo reader uses the registered repo whitelist as the repo-level
authorization boundary and `.ignore` as the only content-level exclusion
source. GPT-facing calls use `repo_id` plus repo-relative paths. CodeGraph is
the indexed metadata backend, while repo-harness owns authorization, fallback,
snapshot semantics, audit, and mutation preconditions.

For tool reference, JSON examples, repo administration, privacy/audit, and
known limits, see:

```text
docs/reference-configs/general-repo-mcp.md
```

For index stale, CodeGraph down, manifest incomplete, mutation conflict, and
reindex dead-letter operations, see:

```text
deploy/runbooks/general-repo-mcp-codegraph.md
```

## Dev Mode Agent Runner

The default planner Connector does not run Codex or Claude. If you intentionally want ChatGPT to trigger a local agent from MCP, use the `orchestrator` profile and enable the dev runner setting yourself.

Local config setting:

```json
{
  "devMode": {
    "agentRunner": true,
    "allowedAgents": ["codex"],
    "timeoutMs": 120000
  }
}
```

Equivalent one-shot launch:

```bash
repo-harness mcp serve --repo . --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765 --profile orchestrator --enable-dev-runner --dev-runner-agents codex
```

Environment override:

```bash
REPO_HARNESS_MCP_DEV_RUNNER=1 REPO_HARNESS_MCP_DEV_RUNNER_AGENTS=codex,claude repo-harness mcp serve --repo . --transport http --profile orchestrator
```

When enabled, the server exposes `run_agent_goal`. The tool reads only `.ai/harness/handoff/codex-goal.md` and runs that fixed handoff through the allowed local CLI:

```text
codex exec --json --cd <repo> <goal>
claude -p <goal>
```

Keep this behind local Developer Mode and per-call confirmations. Do not expose an orchestrator tunnel to untrusted users.

## Agent Handoff Contract

The agent-facing Skill is installed at:

```text
.agents/skills/repo-harness-chatgpt-bridge/SKILL.md
```

Use it in Codex when continuing a ChatGPT-generated handoff:

```text
Use repo-harness-chatgpt-bridge.
Execute .ai/harness/handoff/codex-goal.md.
```

The Skill tells Codex to read the PRD and checklist Sprint, preserve stage gates, run focused checks, and stage each completed phase. It does not authorize ChatGPT to edit source code or run shell commands through MCP.

## Tool Chain

Expected planning chain:

```text
idea
  -> write_prd_from_idea
  -> write_checklist_sprint
  -> prepare_codex_goal_from_sprint
  -> local Codex /goal execution
```

Local fallback for the last handoff step:

```bash
repo-harness mcp prepare-goal --repo . --prd plans/prds/<feature>.prd.md --sprint plans/sprints/<feature>.sprint.md --reference-repo <optional-readonly-reference>
```

## Test Prompt

```text
Use repo-harness to inspect this repo. Call harness_status, latest_handoff, and list_workflow_files. Do not write files.
```

## Reader Test Prompt

```text
Use the repo-harness Connector. First call discover_harness_repos with query/name/repo_path when the user gives repo-like text such as "my-app/", then choose the exact registered repo_id. Call get_repo_capabilities, repo_manifest, list_tree on ".", read_file on README.md or docs/spec.md, and search_text for "repo-harness". Do not write files.
```

Blocked-file smoke:

```text
Use the general repo reader to try read_file with "../outside", an absolute path, and one path that the repo's .ignore excludes. These must return path-policy errors. If the repo contains an external symlink, read_file on that symlink must return SYMLINK_ESCAPE. Do not print file contents while testing blocked paths.
```

## Connector Invocation Evidence

Treat Connector readiness as four independent checks:

1. Endpoint: the sidecar and public HTTPS `/mcp` endpoint respond.
2. Schema: ChatGPT Connector settings show the expected Action after Refresh.
3. Selection: a fresh chat has the recorded Connector selected from `+` -> More.
4. Invocation: the current model surface emits a real tool call.

Only a visible `Called tool` event with the selected Action/result, or an
equivalent captured tool-call transcript, proves MCP invocation. Connector
selection, assistant self-report, plausible JSON, or sandbox shell commands do
not prove that ChatGPT called MCP.

For Pro runs, the normal tool-call runtime UI may not appear the way it does for
other models because Pro uses a sandbox/process flow. In the visible ChatGPT Web
UI, click the assistant's `Thinking` / `Thought for ...` disclosure to open
the right-side process pane. Use that pane to confirm whether Pro actually
emitted a `Called tool` event for the selected app, which action it chose, or
whether it only reasoned inside the sandbox without invoking MCP. If the pane
shows sandbox-only exploration, or the answer reports `app_unavailable` without
a tool event, classify the outcome as `surface_blocked`, not as a broken repo
or sidecar.

Detailed Pro Extended planning and review tasks commonly take 15 minutes or
more. When driving Pro through the browser path, do not treat elapsed time as
failure while the session is still alive; wait for a final answer or a concrete
browser, login, capture, or tool-call failure. Keep the Oracle heartbeat enabled;
heartbeat diagnostics such as `no thinking status detected yet` are progress
signals, not blockers by themselves.

Outcome labels:

- `invocation_verified`: real `Called tool` event or captured tool-call transcript.
- `approval_pending`: a real tool request produced a confirmation prompt.
- `surface_blocked`: schema is current, but the current model surface did not call MCP.
- `bundle_fallback`: Pro is reviewing a local evidence bundle and did not read through MCP.

When Pro is `surface_blocked`, use `repo-harness-chatgpt` to send a bounded
local evidence bundle through the existing Oracle/browser handoff. The bundle
must say it was produced locally, list included and omitted/truncated material,
and include:

```yaml
source: local_repo_harness_bundle
pro_invoked_mcp: false
working_tree: clean | dirty
```

Do not claim MCP read-back evidence for fallback output. Pro can plan or review
the supplied bundle, while Codex still executes and verifies locally.

Permission scope is separate from invocation evidence. Setup uses the global
registered repo index, not one Connector per project. Random external
directories are still excluded unless the local user adds explicit
`--allow-root` entries; broad full-disk read is not a supported default.
Repo-scope MCP storage is retired; `repo-harness mcp migrate-scope` is the only
supported path off it.

## PRD Prompt

```text
Use repo-harness discover_harness_repos first, pass query/name/repo_path when the user gives repo-like text such as "my-app/", choose the exact target repo_path, inspect docs/spec.md, tasks/current.md, latest handoff, and existing plans in that repo, then convert this idea into a PRD with write_prd_from_idea using the same repo_path. Do not edit source code.
```

## Checklist Sprint Prompt

```text
Use repo-harness to read the target repo PRD by repo_path. Convert it into an ordered checklist Sprint with write_checklist_sprint using the same repo_path. Every task card must include a stage gate that requires Codex to stage the completed phase before continuing.
```

## Codex Goal Prompt

```text
Use repo-harness prepare_codex_goal_from_sprint with repo_path, the PRD path, and the checklist Sprint path. Return the host-native /goal prompt. Do not run Codex remotely.
```

Equivalent local CLI:

```bash
repo-harness mcp prepare-goal --repo . --prd plans/prds/<feature>.prd.md --sprint plans/sprints/<feature>.sprint.md --reference-repo <optional-readonly-reference>
```

## Codex Executor Prompt

```text
Use repo-harness-chatgpt-bridge. Execute the latest ChatGPT-generated Codex goal from .ai/harness/handoff/codex-goal.md.
```

## Troubleshooting

- If ChatGPT cannot connect, verify the tunnel URL is HTTPS and ends in `/mcp`.
- If ChatGPT returns unauthorized, verify OAuth discovery works and re-run the authorization passphrase flow.
- If tools are missing, restart `repo-harness mcp serve` and rescan tools.
- Run `repo-harness mcp doctor --repo . --live` to verify config, local server, tunnel, OAuth, initialize, and exact `tools/list` schema without printing credentials.
- If workflow artifact writes fail, verify the target path is a PRD, sprint, plan, or approved handoff file.
- If general repo writes fail, call `get_repo_capabilities`; write tools require a repo registered with `accessMode: "read_write"`.
- If ChatGPT generated prose instead of checklist Sprint task cards, ask it to use write_checklist_sprint.
- If Codex cannot see the server, run `repo-harness mcp setup codex --repo . --scope project`.

## Security Notes

- The default planner Connector exposes workflow planning tools plus read-only access to registered adopted repos' non-ignored files.
- MCP config, bearer token, OAuth passphrase, and OAuth token store live only under `~/.repo-harness/` (or `REPO_HARNESS_HOME`), never inside a repo working tree.
- Registered repo paths are loaded from `~/.repo-harness/registered-repos.json` and revalidated against live repo-harness adoption markers before use.
- External read-only workspace roots appear in the same Connector only when the local user enables reader capability with explicit allowed roots.
- The `/mcp` endpoint requires OAuth-issued Bearer tokens by default. Do not expose it through a tunnel without Connector auth configured.
- `repo-harness mcp serve --auth bearer` is available for non-ChatGPT clients that can send a static bearer token.
- `repo-harness mcp serve --auth url-token` is a single-user compatibility mode that accepts the same token in either `Authorization: Bearer` or `?repo_harness_token=`; logs and shared docs must not include the token.
- Legacy workspace reader mode keeps deny globs for `.env`, private keys, SSH keys, credentials, secrets, `.git`, and dependency/build output. The general repo API uses `.ignore` as the content filter and relies on repo registration plus path guards.
- Planner profile cannot write application source files, package manifests, lockfiles, CI config, secrets, or files outside the repo root.
- Coding profile is fail-closed without explicit `read_write` grants. Its shell has local-user authority; allowed roots constrain workspace selection, not shell access.
- MCP does not expose a default Codex runner. It prepares `.ai/harness/handoff/codex-goal.md`; the local Codex host owns `/goal` execution unless the user explicitly enables the local orchestrator dev runner.
- The orchestrator dev runner is local-only, opt-in, timeout-bounded, audited, and limited to the fixed Codex goal handoff. It is not arbitrary shell.
- Keep `_ref/` read-only when used as a comparison source.
- Do not put tunnel tokens, OAuth tokens, passphrases, or ChatGPT/Codex credentials in git.
