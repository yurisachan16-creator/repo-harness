/**
 * D6 secret redaction: deny-by-construction. A fixed denylist of secret env
 * var NAMES plus a high-entropy token pattern; any matched substring of the
 * ORIGINAL text is replaced with `sha256:<hash-of-the-secret>`. Pure: this
 * module never reads `process.env` itself -- the caller (an effects module)
 * collects the present values and passes them in as `knownSecretValues`.
 *
 * EPC-05 gatekeeper CRITICAL fix (typed-field exemption at the construction
 * boundary, "Option B"; a within-letter D6 refinement -- D6's frozen text
 * pins the invariant that secrets never appear raw, not this exact entropy
 * pattern, per the EPC-01 acceptance record): the bare entropy pattern was
 * mangling legitimate structured payload values that happen to be 32+ chars
 * of `[A-Za-z0-9+/_-]` with no breaking dot -- an already-computed sha256
 * hash value got double-hashed (`sha256:sha256:...`), and any repo-relative
 * path whose directory+filename-stem run is 32+ chars (any realistic
 * contract slug) had that whole run replaced with a hash, e.g.
 * `tasks/contracts/<long-slug>.contract.md` -> `sha256:<hash>.contract.md`.
 * Live repro: `evt-01KY4YMNNF0BFAPHV968AX04J6` in the EPC-05 worktree's own
 * ledger (a real `verify-sprint` run against this package's own,
 * realistic-length contract slug).
 *
 * Four typed exemptions from entropy redaction are applied structurally --
 * classified BEFORE the entropy pass runs, never a post-hoc unhash:
 *
 *   1. Declared hash: a whole string value matching
 *      `^(sha256:)?[0-9a-f]{40,64}$` is already a hash or a raw git commit
 *      SHA (40 hex chars) -- entropy-redacting it a second time is exactly
 *      the double-prefix bug. Whole-value match only; a hash or SHA
 *      embedded inside a longer free-text string (e.g. a full command
 *      line) is NOT exempted by this rule and keeps the entropy pattern for
 *      that embedded span.
 *   2. Declared or inferred path: a field whose KEY follows the existing
 *      path-key convention (`path`/`_path`/`Path` suffix -- the same
 *      convention `src/effects/evidence/event-writer.ts`'s `isPathFieldKey`
 *      enforces fail-closed repo-relative validation for; duplicated here
 *      as a one-line convention check, not imported, since this is a core
 *      module and must not depend on the effects layer) is exempt, AND --
 *      because several real run-trace fields carry paths without following
 *      that key convention (`run_file`, `lifecycle.snapshot`,
 *      `contract.file`, `active_plan`; never renamed to fit the
 *      convention, since these are established consumer-facing field
 *      names outside this package's authority to rewrite) -- a value that
 *      WHOLE-VALUE parses as a safe repo-relative path is exempt too:
 *      contains `/`, no leading `/`, no `..` path-traversal segment, and
 *      ends with a file extension (a final dot-suffix on the string). This
 *      is a lightweight redaction-exemption heuristic only, not a security
 *      validator -- `src/effects/path-safety.ts`'s `ensureRepoRelativePath`
 *      remains the actual fail-closed check for path-key-convention fields,
 *      unchanged and still enforced by `event-writer.ts` independently of
 *      this module.
 *   3. Repo-harness protocol identifiers: whole values under `schema` or
 *      `kind` that match the public `repo-harness-...` identifier grammar.
 *      These values are consumer-facing discriminants, not secrets; hashing
 *      them makes an otherwise fingerprinted nested evidence envelope
 *      unverifiable after ledger materialization. Known-secret matching still
 *      runs before this exemption, exactly as for hashes and paths.
 *   4. Change Assessment oracle identifiers: the whole `id` leaf only when
 *      its structural path ends in `required_oracles/<array-index>/id`.
 *      Oracle IDs are committed contract authority and participate in the
 *      assessment, selection-packet, and evidence fingerprints; rewriting
 *      one while preserving those hashes creates a self-inconsistent
 *      verification envelope. This is deliberately not a general `id`
 *      exemption. Known-secret matching still runs first.
 *
 * All exemptions skip ONLY the entropy pattern. The secret-value denylist
 * check (`findKnownSecretSpans`) still runs unconditionally over every
 * field, exempted or not -- a literal secret value sitting in a hash-shaped
 * or path-shaped position must still be replaced. Free-text fields (no
 * matching exemption -- e.g. a command line embedding a path inside other
 * words, `branch`, or any bare identifier with no path separator+extension)
 * are unaffected by this refinement and remain subject to entropy redaction
 * exactly as before; this is an accepted, out-of-ruling-scope residual since
 * no consumer gates on those fields' exact value.
