// invocation, and transcript recovery are effects
// (src/effects/review/cross-review-runner.ts); this module only shapes their
// inputs/outputs and normalizes/classifies already-collected text and
// process-outcome facts.
//
// Scope capture itself is NOT re-derived here or in the effects layer: the
// plan requires reusing src/effects/review/diff-fingerprint.ts's
// buildReviewSubject rather than adding a third Git scope parser. This file
// only defines the shape that reused output is projected into.
