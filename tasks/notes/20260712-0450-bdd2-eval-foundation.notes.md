## Design Decisions

- The existing `run-skill-evals.ts` remains unchanged. It measures skill installation
  and workspace mutation, while BDD² S/A measure text proposals and audits. Sharing
  them would create a false abstraction without a common semantic contract.
- `evaluation-manifest.json` is the only committed machine authority. Prompt, task,
  truth, and rubric bytes are pinned by SHA-256; unknown keys, path escapes,
  symlinks, duplicate IDs, hash drift, and truth fields in agent task sets fail closed.
- `foundation` is intentionally non-executable. A later experiment row must expand
  each held-out arm to the preregistered 12 tasks, freeze agent model/sampling/command
  profiles, set `sealed_at`, commit the authority, and run from a clean Git HEAD.
- The runner records the clean source commit and manifest hash at execution time.
  This avoids an impossible self-referential commit hash inside the commit being
  pinned while still producing an immutable run coordinate.
- Model and sampling authority lives only in the sealed agent profile; `freeze` does
  not duplicate it. Blind packets exclude condition, repetition, prompt, agent,
  model, sampling, truth, and private coordinate fields.
- PR #53 review remediation removes the deterministic public packet ID entirely.
  Deterministic 16-hex coordinates remain private for reproducible execution;
  adjudication packets receive independent 128-bit IDs from `crypto.randomBytes`.
- A sealed run now treats the manifest, runner, every treatment prompt, both task
  and truth partitions, rubric, and score schema as one committed authority set.
  It refuses any member that is ignored/untracked even when the worktree otherwise
  appears clean.
- Browser and ImageGen remain first-class later experiments in Sprint row BDD2-E-04.
  They were not deleted or bundled into the S/A foundation.

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

- None recorded.

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Refit `run-skill-evals.ts` into a generic core | Rejected | Its workspace/skill semantics do not match proposal/audit treatments; refactoring would risk the existing benchmark for no proven reuse. |
| Permit real runs from the foundation manifest | Rejected | Model, full held-out set, commit, and final seal are not frozen yet; accepting a run would create non-authoritative evidence. |
| Store truth beside agent tasks | Rejected | A renderer bug could leak seeded answers; exact task schemas and separate truth files make the boundary testable. |
| Put model in both `freeze` and agent profile | Rejected | Dual authority can drift; the sealed agent profile owns model, sampling, command, and response source. |
| Create product skill/CLI now | Rejected | The approved PRD authorizes Phase E only and explicitly forbids Phase P surface before a recorded pass decision. |

## Open Questions

- None.

## Evidence Links

- Checks: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Full suite: `bun test` — 1146 passed, 1 platform skip, 0 failed.
- Focused suite: `bun test tests/run-bdd2-evals.test.ts tests/bdd2-evals-contract.test.ts` — 11 passed after PR review remediation.
- Typecheck: `bun run check:type` — passed.
- Foundation validation: `bun scripts/run-bdd2-evals.ts validate` — valid.
- Dry-run plan: `bun scripts/run-bdd2-evals.ts plan --experiment S --partition development --dry-run` — deterministic coordinates emitted.
- Required checks: deploy SQL, architecture sync, task sync, inspector, and direct migration dry-run passed.
- Module PR: <https://github.com/Ancienttwo/repo-harness/pull/53>.
- Post-review rebase: branch rebased onto `origin/main` at `8e16032` after PR #54
  advanced the base. The refreshed handoff plus `LC_ALL=C repo-harness run
  check-task-workflow --strict` now pass; the former brain mirror drift was resolved
  upstream and was not copied into this branch.
- Advisory environment gaps: Codex Waza `health`/`check` installed-copy paths and the
  worktree-local CodeGraph index are absent; focused/full tests and source checks are
  unaffected, and no user-level environment mutation was authorized by this contract.

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.

## Promotion Candidates

- Promote to `tasks/lessons.md` only after a repeated correction or failure pattern.
- Promote to `docs/researches/` only when it is durable repo knowledge with evidence.
- Promote to harness asset files only after verification across more than one task or fixture.

## Minimal-change Audit

- New dependencies: none. Random blinding uses the Node/Bun standard-library
  `crypto.randomBytes`; hashing, filesystem, process, and Git behavior continue to
  use existing standard-library/platform surfaces.
- New files: each committed file owns a distinct Phase E datum or evidence boundary:
  one manifest, four treatment prompts, two task partitions, two separate truth
  partitions, one human rubric, one score schema, one runner, two focused tests, and
  the repository-required PRD/Sprint/plan/contract/review/notes/current projections.
  Combining task and truth files would violate blinding; adding a sidecar/catalog or
  shared package would add authority without a second consumer and was rejected.
- New abstractions: no shared package, provider wrapper, compatibility parser, or
  extension registry was added. `FileReference` and the local authority-path list
  protect one cross-file invariant inside the single runner.
- Deleted/shrunk behavior: the reversible deterministic public `packetId` path was
  removed rather than retained behind an alias. There is no compatibility fallback;
  old 16-hex score packet IDs now fail the v1 schema explicitly.
