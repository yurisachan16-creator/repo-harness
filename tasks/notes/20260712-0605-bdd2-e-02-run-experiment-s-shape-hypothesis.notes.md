## Design Decisions

- Cut directly from unused global-seal v1 to per-experiment-seal v2. S and A own
  separate product claims and Sprint rows; requiring both datasets before either
  run would silently couple their evidence boundaries. No v1 compatibility parser
  is retained because E-01 produced no valid sealed run consumer.
- Agent execution receives the packet on stdin from a fresh OS temporary cwd.
  Running Codex in the repo would allow the model to inspect held-out truth despite
  truth being absent from the prompt, invalidating the experiment.
- The first real smoke showed that an isolated cwd plus `--ignore-user-config`
  still loaded user-level skill/plugin descriptions. That freeze was discarded.
  Revision S-v2 additionally supplies a fresh temporary HOME/CODEX_HOME containing
  only a mode-0600 copy of `auth.json`, so credentials remain available while
  skills, plugins, config, memories, rules, and local state do not enter the model
  envelope.
- Add one frozen metric specification because the summarizer consumes it and it
  prevents post-hoc gate arithmetic. Raw run evidence and scores remain ignored;
  only the aggregate decision report is tracked.
- The original protocol treated human blind adjudication as a hard evidence
  boundary. Automated reviewer output could not satisfy that authority or be
  relabeled as human evidence; the owner-authorized deviation below changes the
  panel type while preserving that labeling constraint.

## Protocol Deviation

- After the completed 72-output run remained blocked for three consecutive turns
  with 0/72 human scores, the owner explicitly replied `同意，继续` to the stated
  option of changing the acceptance authority to Agent adjudication.
- The reviewer authority is therefore changed to an owner-authorized, condition-blind
  Agent panel. Prompts, tasks, model profile, frozen metric arithmetic, raw responses,
  blind IDs, and private mappings remain unchanged.
- This is proxy evidence, not human adjudication. Reports and reviews must retain
  that label; no Phase P productization claim may silently cite it as human evidence.

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

- Latest `main` briefly tracked the user-retained V0 as
  `plans/prds/20260712-BDD.prd.md`, which failed the canonical PRD filename gate.
  The independent base repair preserved it unchanged at
  `plans/archive/20260712-1426-bdd-v0.prd.md`; E-02 consumes that mainline path and
  adds no parser exception or filename compatibility alias.

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Expand both S and A to satisfy the global seal | Reject | Violates independent hypothesis/PR boundaries and mixes unfinished Audit authority into E-02. |
| Preserve v1 plus an optional per-experiment field | Reject | Creates dual semantics and compatibility code before any real consumer exists. |
| Run agents from repository cwd | Reject | Makes private held-out truth filesystem-readable. |
| Add a generic eval framework/dependency | Reject | One runner already owns the invariant; no second consumer justifies an abstraction. |

## Open Questions

- None for E-02. The recorded decision is `Reshape`; a future Shape prompt revision
  and rerun is a separate authority revision, not an edit to this result.

## Experiment S Result

- Panel: three condition-blind Agent reviewers with `fork_turns=none`, 24 unique
  packets each and non-overlapping score directories; 72/72 scores validated before
  reveal.
- Decision: `Reshape`.
- Unsupported expansion: 48 baseline vs 2 treatment, 95.8% reduction; paired
  win/tie/loss 12/22/2.
- Required behavior omission: 23 baseline vs 0 treatment; no stable new omission.
- New treatment P0/P1 protected omission: 0.
- Correction-time median: 10 minutes baseline vs 0 treatment.
- Failed gate: one unnecessary tracked artifact. `S-H-12` repetition 1 escalated
  an already-resolved cancellation/charging contract to PRD.
- Remaining treatment expansions: `S-H-08` repetitions 1 and 2 required continued
  offline editing beyond the supplied request/current truth.
- Conclusion: the evidence supports narrowing the escalation trigger to unresolved
  product decisions and tightening adjacent-capability handling before rerun. It
  does not authorize Phase P productization.

## Verification Status

- After merging current `main`, repository-wide `bun test` passes under Bun
  1.3.14 with 1141 passed, 1 platform skip, and 0 failures. The mainline stdout
  completion fix removed the earlier macOS truncation failure without widening
  E-02 scope.
- E-02 focused tests, TypeScript no-emit, source-commit manifest/plan and 72/72
  score validation, deterministic metric-core re-summary, current foundation
  validation, deploy SQL ordering,
  architecture sync, task sync, strict workflow, and project-state inspection pass.
- `scripts/migrate-project-template.sh` was retired by the mainline transactional
  TypeScript adoption cutover, so the stale shell command is no longer a runnable
  verification surface. Current `inspect-project-state` reports no drift or
  required decision. The agent-tooling diagnostic completed with host-level Waza,
  gbrain, and CodeGraph advisories that do not affect this already-completed
  evaluation run.

## Evidence Links

- Checks: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Frozen authority commit: `cd9e0426d362614ba277e067633db2596c236491`.
- Completed raw run: `.ai/harness/runs/bdd2/bdd2-e02-shape-s-v2/` — 72/72
  successful packets, 12 tasks, two conditions, three repetitions, no skill/plugin
  leakage in agent stderr.
- Reviewer-safe queue: `.ai/harness/runs/bdd2/bdd2-e02-shape-s-v2-blind-review/`
  — 72 randomized packets plus frozen rubric/schema, with no private mapping.
- Tracked aggregate report: `evals/bdd2/reports/experiment-s.md`.
- Tracked scored-coordinate authority: `evals/bdd2/reports/experiment-s-evidence.json`.
  This is the durable scored-coordinate authority used by CI; ignored raw files are
  local provenance cache, not a second maintained source.

## External Review Resolution

- Claude's first independent review correctly found that the frozen Shape
  summarizer validates the truth file but does not consume it when aggregating
  reviewer scores. This was a frozen protocol choice for blind scoring, but no
  truth-aware adjudication stage followed it.
- A post-reveal deterministic comparison found nine selected authority tiers that
  differ from `truth/held-out.json#shape_tasks.*.expected_authority`, beyond the
  eight scores explicitly marked `incorrect`. Truth-aware authority mismatches are
  12 baseline versus 5 treatment; the generated 7 versus 1 figure is retained only
  as the reviewer-coded metric and is labeled as such in the report.
- The review also confirmed that the Agent panel had one score per packet with no
  overlap, and that reviewer delivery excluded private mappings by convention but
  not by an OS-enforced filesystem boundary. These are evidence-grade limitations,
  not facts that can be repaired after reveal without creating a new experiment
  revision.
- A later cross-model pass found that S-v2 inherited all caller environment
  variables into the Agent subprocess. Isolated HOME/CODEX_HOME therefore did not
  provide a reproducible or secret-minimal execution envelope. S-v2 is retained as
  failed evidence only; current authority is an unsealed S-v3 foundation with no
  agent profile and a runner-level environment allowlist.
- Final closeout review found that the agent `--version` probe still inherited
  `process.env` even though the model invocation did not. The probe now runs in
  its own temporary cwd/HOME with the same minimal allowlist, and the sealed-run
  regression proves a caller secret cannot reach it. No compatibility path was
  added; runner and durable evidence hashes were re-bound to the corrected code.
- Exact-fingerprint review then found that the historical evidence projector
  counted packets and scores without proving the complete source-commit
  task × condition × repetition coordinate set. The projector now loads and
  content-verifies the historical task and truth sets, reconstructs all expected
  coordinates, rejects missing/duplicate/unexpected coordinates, validates
  coordinate and prompt hashes plus agent metadata, and binds every score to its
  blind response. Duplicate-coordinate and prompt-drift regressions cover the
  failure boundary.
- The same review noted that the current shared score schema is Shape-only. That
  is acceptable only while Experiment A remains foundation-only and unrunnable;
  E-03 must cut authority to per-experiment score schemas before sealing A. E-02
  does not add an A compatibility branch or hidden A implementation.
- The tracked report now discloses all identified limits and keeps the decision at
  `Reshape`. The generated 72-row durable evidence is validated against held-out
  tasks/truth and reproduced byte-for-byte from local blind responses, scores,
  private coordinates, and the source-commit manifest. Kill-path,
  coordinate-integrity, and environment-allowlist regression coverage are added
  without rewriting the S-v2 source commit, prompts, scores, or raw outputs.

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.

## Promotion Candidates

- Promote to `tasks/lessons.md` only after a repeated correction or failure pattern.
- Promote to `docs/researches/` only when it is durable repo knowledge with evidence.
- Promote to harness asset files only after verification across more than one task or fixture.
