## Why

Closeout currently treats the recorded external acceptance and `merge-gate`'s
second Claude invocation as two independent semantic authorities. That repeats
private-diff transfer and provider cost, makes a legitimate typed user waiver
impossible, and couples non-overlapping target movement to another semantic
review. If this ships wrong, closeout can either accept stale semantic work or
continue paying the same duplicate review/test/CI cost before HRD-08.

## Goal

Establish one structured `AcceptanceReceipt` for semantic acceptance and one
provider-free exact local merge seal. `external_pass`, `user_waiver`, and
`reject` remain distinct; reviewer identity is frozen in the contract; review
Markdown is projection only; semantic change or target overlap invalidates the
receipt; lifecycle-only change and non-overlapping target movement do not.

## Scope

- In scope: CI trigger/concurrency waste guardrails; base-fetch/freeze ordering;
  merge-gate timeout; strict acceptance policy/receipt helper; receipt
  projection; verify-sprint/finish/ship cutover; provider-free local seal;
  removal of obsolete merge-gate Claude runtime; helper/hook/template/docs and
  test projections.
- Out of scope: HRD-08/09 implementation; changing Codex safety approval;
  merging or editing the concurrent `solo-operator-acceptance-policy` worktree;
  legacy prose/receipt compatibility reads; automatic merge authorization.
- Taste constraints: one semantic authority, one subject authority, no fallback
  reviewer, no provider retry loop, and no silent waiver-to-pass translation.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.
- Stop if normalized review-subject exclusions allow a semantic path to escape
  invalidation, or if the same closeout fixture can invoke a provider twice.
- Stop if the concurrent solo-operator branch lands on `main`; rebase and remove
  the superseded authority before continuing rather than merge both.

## Falsifier

A fixture where a review-only change alters the normalized subject, a semantic
change leaves it unchanged, or target overlap remains zero after a reviewed path
changes falsifies the design. The cheapest proof is the focused
`tests/acceptance-receipt.test.ts` subject/overlap matrix.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260721-0601-closeout-single-acceptance-authority.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260721-0601-closeout-single-acceptance-authority.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20260721-0601-closeout-single-acceptance-authority.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion uses the new cutover directly: `verify-sprint`, finish, and ship
  consume the same structured AcceptanceReceipt and never parse review prose as
  authority.

    - "user_waiver remains distinct from external_pass and succeeds only when the contract allows it"
    - "review-only and lifecycle-only changes preserve acceptance; semantic changes and overlapping target movement invalidate it"
    - "one PR commit matches only the pull_request CI trigger, not a codex branch push trigger"
```

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: one typed acceptance receipt plus one exact local seal.
- Edge cases: reject, forbidden waiver, malformed policy/receipt, review-only
  change, semantic change, target overlap zero/nonzero, lifecycle archive, base
  movement between finish and push.
- Regression risks: helper/source mirror drift; concurrent solo-operator work
  must not land.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: execution base `5e10ce8177e832978ad2bd42b49e5ed74e58342c`.
- Revert strategy: revert the single PR before HRD-08, delete host-state runtime
  receipts/seals, and recreate any downstream contract; do not add dual reads.
