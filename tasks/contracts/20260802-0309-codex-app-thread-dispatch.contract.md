## Why

The repo's Codex delegation surfaces name native MultiAgentV2 `spawn_agent` as the preferred runner, but the native flat V2 spawn schema cannot select Luna: a `fast-worker` (gpt-5.6-luna/max) dispatch silently inherits the parent model (falsified canary: `plans/plan-20260711-0219-codex-native-role-model-override.md:52-54`, Blocked). Until the preferred runner points at Codex App Thread dispatch, every Codex-side fast-worker run executes on the wrong model and the fleet's model routing is fiction.

## Goal

Re-point the Codex-side delegated-runner preference from native `spawn_agent` to Codex App Thread dispatch (`codex_app__create_thread` with the role's exact `model` + reasoning effort from the installed `~/.codex/agents/<role>.toml`), demote native spawn to an evidence-gated declared fallback (fail-closed: a role whose exact model/effort the native live spawn schema does not accept skips native and degrades to codex-exec → main-thread on the SAME contract, degradation recorded), and encode the thread-lifecycle rules (unique task id, pendingWorktreeId is not a thread id, materialization via official thread read, requested-vs-observed model separation, adopt results only after reading the final turn, archive threads one at a time, no worker re-derivation) in the advisor and standing-authorization surfaces. Execute exactly the plan body in `plans/plan-20260802-0309-codex-app-thread-dispatch.md` (## In scope / ## Out of scope / ## Exit Criteria are authoritative).

## Scope

- In scope: `.ai/harness/policy.json#delegation` (preferred_runners + runner_rule/rule prose); `src/cli/hook/subagent-handler.ts` `runDelegationAdvisor` sharedRules + runner-preference sentence; `src/cli/hook/session-context.ts` `codexDelegationAutoContext` standing-authorization block; `docs/reference-configs/external-tooling.md` + `assets/reference-configs/external-tooling.md` (byte-identical pair); `tests/subagent-handler.test.ts`, `tests/session-context.test.ts`. Round 2 (gate findings): downstream delegation seeds in `scripts/lib/project-init-lib.sh` + `scripts/ensure-task-workflow.sh` + `assets/templates/helpers/ensure-task-workflow.sh` synced to the new policy values with `tests/create-project-dirs.runtime.test.ts` pins updated; symmetric thread-path fail-closed clause in both hook files.
- Out of scope: any new hook route/CLI helper/evidence field for thread routing; the reference skill's RoutePlan/ledger Python tooling; `scripts/install-agent-fleet.sh` + assets mirror; `.codex/agents/*.toml` fixtures; `scripts/check-agent-tooling.sh`; cap changes; anything under real `~/.claude/` or `~/.codex/`; live create_thread canary.
- Taste constraints: no model-ID literals under `src/` (reference the role's installed TOML instead); keep the `# Delegation Standing Authorization` header and `spawn no more than ${maxAgents}` phrasing; do not disturb EXECUTION_BOUNDARY byte parity.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If the Codex App `create_thread` surface on this host rejects an explicit `model`/`thinking` per thread (no such parameters in its live schema), thread-first dispatch cannot honor per-role models either and the direction is wrong. Cheapest proof point: the wording stays evidence-gated (requested vs observed model recorded from official thread reads), so a real canary thread on the user's Codex host is the post-merge check; this slice must not claim runtime readiness.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior:
- Edge cases:
- Regression risks:

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: worktree base `7e7d9bc2` on branch `codex/codex-app-thread-dispatch`.
- Revert strategy: drop the branch / revert the reviewed diff; no state outside this worktree is touched until the orchestrator orders ship.
