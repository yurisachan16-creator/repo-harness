## Why

Experiment S is the first proof that a lightweight Behavior Card improves product
judgment rather than merely adding structure. A leaky, post-hoc, or cross-coupled
benchmark could authorize an unnecessary product module and invalidate every later
Phase E gate.

## Goal

Produce 72 frozen held-out Shape outputs, owner-authorized condition-blind Agent scores, reproducible
paired metrics, and an explicit Pass / Reshape / Kill decision without adding any
Phase P product surface.

## Scope

- In scope: per-experiment v2 evaluation authority; complete 12-task S set and
  private truth; isolated Codex execution; blind score validation; frozen Shape
  metrics; 72-output run; tracked report and decision.
- Out of scope: Experiment A/E/I execution or claims; Browser/ImageGen; public BDD
  skill/CLI/MCP/hook/check integration; Brief catalog/validator/sidecar/lifecycle;
  Agent scores represented as human evidence. Agent-panel results must remain
  explicitly labeled proxy evidence.
- Taste constraints: no dependencies, generic benchmark framework, compatibility
  parser, or second handwritten machine authority. Every new file must be a frozen
  authority or durable result with a named consumer.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.
- Stop if selected S authority is not clean, tracked, hash-valid, and independently
  sealed, or if agent/reviewer packets can expose truth or condition identity.
- Stop before result claims and PR completion when locked condition-blind owner-authorized Agent
  scores are unavailable.

## Falsifier

Kill or reshape Shape when unsupported expansion improves less than the
pre-registered threshold, wins do not exceed losses, required omissions increase,
or treatment introduces a P0/P1 protected omission. The cheapest proof is the
12-task proposal-only experiment; do not proceed to implementation pilot first.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260712-0605-bdd2-e-02-run-experiment-s-shape-hypothesis.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260712-0605-bdd2-e-02-run-experiment-s-shape-hypothesis.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20260712-0605-bdd2-e-02-run-experiment-s-shape-hypothesis.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: `repo-harness run verify-sprint` must see this contract pass, the review recommend pass, and `## External Acceptance Advice` pass or record a manual override.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: historical S-v2 run and decision remain traceable to their
  source commit; current S-v3 authority is fail-closed after the inherited-env flaw.
- Edge cases: zero baseline denominator, missing/duplicate/mismatched scores,
  stable/new severe omissions, unsealed S/A, caller-secret environment leakage,
  command-version drift, dirty/untracked authority, and agent failure.
- Regression risks: breaking the E-01 foundation contract is intentional only at
  the unused schema boundary; focused tests must prove the direct v2 cutover.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: E-02 authority commit before remote run, followed by the
  adjudicated report commit.
- Revert strategy: revert the E-02 PR and remove ignored raw evidence; no product
  runtime or data migration rollback exists.
