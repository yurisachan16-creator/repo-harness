## Why

The repo's established ship convention is squash merge (#134 onward; #138–#141 this round), but `contract-worktree cleanup` decides "fully merged" by pure ancestry — squash-merged branch commits are never ancestors of main, so the safety gate refuses every legitimately absorbed worktree (2026-07-31: all four shipped worktrees refused despite per-file content verification on main). The gate is structurally dead under the house flow; humans route around it with raw `git worktree remove`, losing the protection entirely.

## Goal

Cleanup's merged-detection becomes two-tier and fail-closed: the existing ancestry fast path stays; a new absorption check treats a branch as merged when `git merge-tree --write-tree <target> <branch>` merges cleanly AND yields a tree OID identical to the target's tree (branch adds nothing). Conflicts, differing trees, or command failure keep refusing. Messages name the matched predicate; all other cleanup safety checks (uncommitted changes, unpushed commits) stay intact. The four existing shipped worktrees' `cleanup --dry-run` flips from refusal to listing deletions (read-only smoke; actual removal happens post-merge by the coordinator).

## Scope

- In scope: the merged-detection segment of `scripts/contract-worktree.sh` cleanup; mirror `assets/templates/helpers/contract-worktree.sh` via `bun run sync:helpers`; new guard `tests/contract-worktree-squash-cleanup.test.ts` (RED-first, positive squash case + fail-closed negative control); notes file.
- Out of scope: contract-worktree start/finish/status branches; merge-gate; other helpers; the remaining cleanup safety checks; actually deleting any existing worktree (smoke is dry-run only).
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If the absorption predicate ever accepts a branch carrying content absent from the target (extra commit, conflicting edit), the change has widened a destructive-operation gate and the direction is wrong. Cheapest proof point: the guard's negative control (branch with one un-merged extra commit must still be refused) passes on unfixed code and must still pass post-fix.

## Root Cause Evidence

- root_cause: the cleanup branch of `scripts/contract-worktree.sh` gates deletion on a pure git-ancestry "fully merged into main" test, so any branch integrated via the repo's standard squash-merge flow (branch commits never become main ancestors) is refused even when `git merge-tree` proves main already contains its entire tree.
- repro: on any squash-merged shipped worktree (verified 2026-07-31 on all four of `mcp-allowed-root-canonicalization` / `cli-init-rename` / `reference-configs-projection` / `receipt-fingerprint-normalization`): `repo-harness run contract-worktree -- cleanup --slug <slug> --dry-run` → `branch codex/<slug> is not fully merged into main; refusing cleanup`, while per-file content checks show everything present on main.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior:
- Edge cases:
- Regression risks:

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: `83792a81` (main at worktree creation, branch `codex/contract-worktree-squash-cleanup`)
- Revert strategy: revert the merge commit — cleanup returns to ancestry-only refusal (safe direction: over-refuses, never over-deletes); the guard's positive case fails again by design.
