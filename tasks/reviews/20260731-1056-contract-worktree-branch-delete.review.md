- Summary: gatekeeper PASS. The sibling squash-cleanup package taught the merge check to accept absorbed branches, but the deletion step still called git branch -d, which is itself ancestry-based, so cleanup half-completed on every squash-merged worktree: the worktree and metadata were removed and the branch was left orphaned, forcing a manual git branch -D that trains the operator to bypass the safety gate. The fix keeps -d for genuine ancestors and uses -D only on the branches the merge check already proved absorbed, so force is scoped to the case where safety was independently established rather than applied blanket. Force-boundary verified: an unmerged branch still takes -d and is still refused. Two adversarial cases were exercised, and the flag-unreachable analysis confirms no path reaches -D without a prior absorbed determination. This run recorded 17/17 exit criteria green including the full Root Cause Evidence gate, allowed_paths clean at 9 files, and full suite green.
- Findings: none
