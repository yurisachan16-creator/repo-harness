- Summary: gatekeeper PASS after one repair round. assets/reference-configs/ is now the declared source and docs/reference-configs/ its byte-identical generated projection, enforced by scripts/sync-reference-configs.ts (--check/--write, modeled on sync-helper-sources.ts) wired into check-ci; the six scattered mirror-equality assertions are replaced by a single loop covering all 23 projected pairs green, and negative verification confirmed the loop fails closed on induced drift rather than silently passing. harness-overview.md was re-unified taking the docs side as truth, justified by the assets side still carrying retired compatibility-fallback wording. The audited LOW-risk test simplifications S1-S5 landed as specified. Verified after replaying onto the merged fingerprint fix 3c991466: 14/14 exit criteria green, allowed_paths clean at 19 files, full suite green, and check:reference-configs green. This receipt was re-recorded under the fixed key-order-invariant fingerprint; the original was unverifiable under the old algorithm.
