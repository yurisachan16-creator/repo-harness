- Summary: gatekeeper PASS. cleanup previously refused every squash-merged contract worktree because its merged check was ancestry-based, and squash merge makes the branch commits non-ancestors of main even though the content landed; with squash as this repo's standard ship path that left the safety gate permanently unusable. The fix keeps the original ancestry check and adds a content-absorption check alongside it, so a branch is accepted when either holds and is still refused when neither does. Both arms were verified fail-closed rather than one masking the other, the errexit trap around the new check was exercised so a failing probe cannot be read as absorbed, and the behavior was re-verified against all four real worktrees left over from this ship sequence. This run recorded 17/17 exit criteria green including the full Root Cause Evidence gate, allowed_paths clean at 9 files, and full suite green.
- Findings: none
