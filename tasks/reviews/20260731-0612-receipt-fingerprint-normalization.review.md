- Summary: gatekeeper PASS with the Root Cause Evidence gate fully green. One-line fix at scripts/acceptance-receipt.ts:244 replacing sha256(JSON.stringify(canonical)) with sha256(stableJson(canonical)); stableJson already existed in the same file at :105-110 and was the local pattern for waiverGrantFingerprint at :274, so the fingerprint becomes key-order invariant with no new abstraction and no change to the evidence ledger storage layer. Root cause of the non-determinism: canonical.benchmark_evidence and canonical.commands are pass-through references into the parsed checks/latest.json, whose key order depends on whether the winning event stayed under the 8192-byte inline cap (producer order preserved) or was offloaded to the blob path (keys recursively sorted), so two semantically identical rematerializations could hash differently. Sealing this package required a bootstrap step, recorded in notes: merge-gate must run from the installed runtime, which still carried the pre-fix algorithm and therefore rejected a valid receipt, so the global install was replaced with a build of this tree under owner approval. The assets/templates/helpers mirror is byte-identical to the script and the falsifier was exercised in both directions. This run recorded 17/17 exit criteria green with allowed_paths clean and full suite green.
