- Summary: Gatekeeper acceptance: archctxCapabilities now resolves archctx as explicit options.consumerRoot override -> target repo dependency tree -> running CLI package root, with the exact-version assertion fail-closed on every path (archctx-provider.ts:159-163, :94, :345). Frozen semantics held and EXECUTION_BOUNDARY respected: no fallback chain, no env knob, no new public surface, drain/queue/Stop gate and version anchors untouched; the only live call site is archctxCapabilities:168, readiness and runArchitectureProjection route through it, and global-runtime.ts:430 keeps prior semantics via the explicit override. Red-first evidence genuine: prefix.log records the unfixed resolver throwing expected archctx@9.9.9, got archctx@0.4.3 with PRE_FIX_EXIT=1 (13 pass / 1 fail). Verification run this session: targeted tests 46 pass / 0 fail; bun run check:type exit 0; full bun test 2445 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 187 files; contract-run preflight preflight_pass; architecture-projection drain --json exit 0 status idle. Live A/B probe against a temp fixture repo pinned to archctx 0.4.2: branch CLI resolved that repo's own binary, unfixed main CLI reported package-local archctx mismatch: expected archctx@0.4.2, got archctx@0.4.3. Scope clean: 8 files, all inside allowed_paths, tasks/todos.md lost exactly the one fulfilled deferred row. Pending-release acceptance: the plan's global installed CLI drain re-verification requires the 0.15.2 publish and global refresh, carried as a release step rather than a defect.
- Findings: P3: archctx-provider.ts:161,:349 - the repo-side search walks up past the repo boundary, so an ancestor project node_modules/archctx counts as the repo vendored copy and a mismatch there fails closed instead of using the CLI copy. Intended per the frozen P3 rule; residual risk for repos nested inside another project dependency tree.; P3: archctx-provider.ts:94 - the mismatch message names the search-origin root (repoRoot) rather than the ancestor directory the offending package.json was found in; diagnostic precision only, the repo/consumer origin distinction required by the plan is present.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Ancestor walk beyond the repo boundary (`src/effects/architecture/archctx-provider.ts:161`, `:349`): `findArchctxPackageRoot` climbs from `repoRoot` to the filesystem root, so an ancestor project's `node_modules/archctx` counts as the repo's vendored copy and a mismatch there fails closed instead of falling back to the CLI copy. This is the frozen P3 rule ("沿 repoRoot 向上爬到第一個命中"), not a defect; it is a residual risk for a repo checked out inside another project's dependency tree.
- Mismatch message names the search origin (`src/effects/architecture/archctx-provider.ts:94`): the error reports `resolved from repo|consumer root <startRoot>`, not the directory the offending `package.json` was actually found in; in a walk-up hit those differ. Diagnostic precision only — the repo-vs-consumer origin distinction the plan required is present.
- Pending-release acceptance: the plan's live re-verification with the globally installed CLI (currently repo-harness 0.15.1 / archctx 0.4.2) can only run after the 0.15.2 publish and global refresh; carried as a release step, not a defect.
