- Summary: gatekeeper PASS on both co-packaged production defects. Defect 1: src/cli/mcp/policy.ts sensitiveAllowedRootReason wrongly matched the realpath canonicalization prefix, falsely denying allowed roots under a shared TMPDIR; RED guard tests/cli/mcp-allowed-root-canonicalization.test.ts plus captured pre-fix artifact showing PRE_FIX_EXIT=1, GREEN after the prefix strip, falsifier exercised across 7 cases. Defect 2: ensure-task-workflow.sh wrote the resume packet before the current status snapshot, which the whole-second no-tolerance comparison in check-task-workflow read as a stale packet; reordered so the snapshot is written first, clearing the helper-scripts.test.ts:5267 failure 5/5. Full suite green under the gate-runner-equivalent TMPDIR=/tmp environment at 2097 pass 0 fail, and this run recorded 18/18 exit criteria with allowed_paths clean at 10 files.
- Findings: none
