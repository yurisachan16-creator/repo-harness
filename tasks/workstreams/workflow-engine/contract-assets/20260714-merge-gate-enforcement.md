## Purpose

Track the one-work-package cutover from advisory gatekeeper review to a local, fail-closed ship receipt.

## TODOs

- [x] Define the host-scoped `merge-gate` skill and strict decision schema.
- [x] Bind host-state receipts to repository, base SHA, head SHA, diff, host config, and installed helper fingerprints.
- [x] Gate contract-worktree merge and ship-worktrees push.
- [x] Restore active workflow state after FAIL/BLOCKED and push/merge only the verified SHA.
- [x] Complete repository verification and external review.
- [x] Close PR review findings, refresh full verification, and record the owner's explicit Claude-review skip without claiming external PASS.
- [x] Archive the workflow after this isolated branch lands on a clean `main`.

## Boundary

- Claude is the only local gatekeeper host in this slice.
- The agent is read-only; the orchestrator owns receipt writes and ship effects.
- GitHub check runs and provider fallback are outside this work-package.

## Notes

- The implementation landed on `main` in `aef22480` via PR #75.
- The source plan and matching workflow artifacts are archived.
