## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass (independent gatekeeper acceptance review PASS; single review at this boundary per review-trigger discipline)
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: `src/cli/commands/state.ts`, `src/core/state/types.ts`, `src/core/state/project-continuation-envelope.ts` (new), `src/effects/state/resolve-continuation-envelope.ts` (new), `tests/continuation-envelope.test.ts` (new), WP2 workflow artifacts
- Actual files changed: exactly the intended set plus machinery timestamp in `tasks/todos.md` (start-task scaffold, attribution verified) and the post-review drift-check test (`tests/sprint-backlog-grammar-drift.test.ts` + fixtures)
- Commands passed: `bun test tests/continuation-envelope.test.ts` (16 pass, 87 asserts); `bun test tests/effective-state.test.ts tests/check-state-boundaries.test.ts` (49 pass); `bun run check:type` clean; `bun scripts/check-state-boundaries.ts` OK (143 files); full `bun test` 2162 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail (gatekeeper, in-worktree); determinism dogfood: two live `state next --json` runs byte-identical, `effective.json` sha256 and `git status` unchanged
- Residual risks: envelope `progress_token` is inspect-scoped and must only be compared envelope-to-envelope, never against an edit-scoped `state resolve` token (binding constraint for WP3); route reason under a fresh handoff folds "Exact Next Step" into `continue_active_plan` (documented, deliberate)
- Reviewer action required: none — MEDIUM shadow-parser finding adjudicated and closed in-worktree with a live-script drift-check test before finish
- Rollback: revert branch `codex/wp2-canonical-continuation-envelope` (base `3ab8fe29`); no primary-tree state touched before finish

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: sprint contract execution (worktree-first), deep-worker implementation + independent gatekeeper acceptance
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: route vocabulary adjudicated in `docs/researches/20260803-loopx-comparative-analysis.md` round-2 addendum; sprint WP2 spec; Falsifier gate produced an 11-condition route decision table with every route deriving from published `EffectiveStateV1` fields + sprint surfaces (recorded in notes)
- Root cause or plan evidence: plan `## Task Breakdown` six slices all delivered; two design forks (next_action discriminator, read-only resolver entry) verified by the gate as worker-level and convention-conforming (`buildStateSnapshot` byte-identical resolver call)

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: satisfied by the independent gatekeeper acceptance review (read-only, fresh context, re-ran every gate itself; differential-probed both sprint parsers 14/14; mutation-tested the read-only proof — substituting the writing resolver fails exactly the no-writes test); one review per boundary
- Commands run: see Human Review Card; all executed inside the worktree with the source CLI
- Manual checks: envelope authority creep (routes derive only from Effective State + sprint surfaces; unit_ref for sprint routes is the sprint path, never a row index; row selection stays with `sprint-backlog`); EXECUTION_BOUNDARY clean (only `--json`; 79-line src diff; core/effects layering respected)
- Supporting artifacts: `tasks/notes/20260803-1949-wp2-canonical-continuation-envelope.notes.md` (route decision table + four non-obvious decisions)
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes — both forks cross-checked against source (`artifact-requirement-policy.ts:79-101`, `resolve-effective-state.ts:696-705`)
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/runs/` (verify-sprint prepare-acceptance)

- Summary: Independent gatekeeper acceptance PASS: all gates re-run in fresh context (16 envelope tests + 6 drift-check tests, 49 state regressions, check:type, state-boundaries 143 files, full suite 2162 pass); determinism and zero-write proven by mutation-tested fixtures and live dogfood; both design forks verified convention-conforming; shadow-parser MEDIUM closed in-worktree with a live-script grammar drift check binding backlogRowStatuses to sprint-backlog.sh. Residual: envelope progress_token is inspect-scoped (envelope-to-envelope comparison only, binding for WP3).
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- New command only: `repo-harness state next --json` (exit 0 on any well-formed envelope including `halt`); existing `state` subcommands unchanged; `resolveEffectiveState` inputs and `progress_token` recipe untouched.
- The command performs zero writes: no `.ai/harness/state/effective.json` publication, no cache, no marker updates — proven by a tree-fingerprint test with demonstrated teeth.
- Sprint backlog grammar now has a drift check: `tests/sprint-backlog-grammar-drift.test.ts` extracts the live `backlog_rows` awk from `scripts/sprint-backlog.sh` at test time and differentially compares it with the TS `backlogRowStatuses` over a shared fixture corpus; one-sided grammar widening in either direction fails the suite.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Envelope `progress_token` is inspect-scoped: compare envelope-to-envelope only, never against an edit-scoped `state resolve` token — binding constraint for WP3's stall counter.
- Fresh-handoff "Exact Next Step" folds into `next_action`, so an all-checked plan with a fresh handoff routes `continue_active_plan` (deliberate, documented in notes).

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 9/10 | six routes fixture-proven; 22 tests incl. drift check; -1 for reason vocabulary still coarse under halt |
| Product depth | 9/10 | fail-closed halts for stale marker/status/grammar anomalies; one-unit-or-halt contract holds |
| Design quality | 9/10 | pure projector + IO-only resolver split; row selection authority untouched; drift check binds the two parsers instead of merging or duplicating authority |
| Code quality | 9/10 | 79-line src diff; matches EffectiveStateV1 conventions; live-script extraction avoids copied grammar |

## Failing Items

- (none)

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test tests/continuation-envelope.test.ts tests/sprint-backlog-grammar-drift.test.ts tests/effective-state.test.ts tests/check-state-boundaries.test.ts && bun run check:type`
- Re-check: `bun scripts/check-state-boundaries.ts`; two consecutive `bun src/cli/index.ts state next --json` runs byte-identical with unchanged tree

## Summary

- WP2 delivers `ContinuationEnvelopeV1` via `repo-harness state next --json`: a deterministic, read-only, one-unit-or-halt projection over Effective State + sprint surfaces with routes `continue_active_plan|advance_sprint|verify_or_finish|halt|complete|idle`, exact-command passthrough for actionable routes, and a live-script grammar drift check binding the TS row reader to `sprint-backlog.sh`. Gatekeeper verdict PASS (differential parser probe 14/14, mutation-tested read-only proof, full suite 2162 pass); MEDIUM drift-check finding closed in-worktree before finish.
