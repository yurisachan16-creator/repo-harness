## Why

GitHub issue #161: dynamic MCP OAuth clients expire on an absolute 30-day TTL while refresh tokens slide (rotation resets 30 days each use). Actively used ChatGPT connectors hit day 30, the client record is cleaned, refresh exchange fails with invalid_client, and the user is forced through periodic re-authorization. The reporter downgraded to read-only url-token mode because of this. If skipped, every OAuth connector breaks monthly regardless of activity.

## Goal

A client whose absolute TTL has elapsed is exempt from cleanup while it still holds active tokens, in both `cleanupExpiredClients()` and the `load()` client filter, using one shared predicate. Active means: an unexpired access token with `info.clientId === clientId`, or an unexpired refresh token whose `accessToken` maps to such a record. Zombie state (expired access + expired refresh lingering from lazy cleanup) must not keep a client alive. Malformed `client_id_issued_at` stays unconditionally deleted (data integrity, not TTL). Net effect: spam registrations still cleaned at 30 days, active users never re-authorize, idle >30 days breaks the whole chain uniformly.

## Scope

- In scope: `src/cli/mcp/oauth.ts` (`McpOAuthTokenStore` cleanup/load predicates only), `tests/cli/mcp-oauth.test.ts` regression cases.
- Out of scope: TTL default values, `registerClient` capacity logic, `createMcpOAuthProvider` behavior, persistence schema changes (no `last_used_at`), unrelated refactors.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If a spam-registered client (never completed authorization) survives past 30 days under the new predicate, the exemption is too broad and the direction is wrong. Cheapest proof point: the "expired client with no tokens is deleted" test case.

## Root Cause Evidence

- root_cause: `src/cli/mcp/oauth.ts:86` — `cleanupExpiredClients()` deletes any client where `client_id_issued_at + dynamicClientTtlSeconds <= now`, ignoring live refresh-token state, so an actively refreshing client is removed at day 30 and subsequent refresh exchanges fail with invalid_client.
- repro: register a client, complete authorization to obtain a refresh token, advance the injected clock past 30 days, call `getClient()` / `exchangeRefreshToken()` — the client is gone and the exchange throws although the refresh token is still valid.
