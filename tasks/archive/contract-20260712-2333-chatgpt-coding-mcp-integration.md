## Why

The coding MCP feature and its authorization-runtime repair passed local, repository, and live functional acceptance on a branch that predates the current mainline MCP rollout-retirement cutover. Merging that branch tree wholesale would resurrect deleted rollout-control authority and stale workflow state; skipping integration leaves the accepted feature unavailable on current main. The integration must preserve both authorities without weakening either. Current main later advanced to `02079da` with a BDD² V0 PRD whose catalog filename and missing Draft status make main's own strict workflow and CI fail; integrating current main therefore also requires the smallest catalog repair before this contract can become green.

## Goal

Replay the seven accepted coding MCP commits onto the rollout-retirement base, merge subsequently advanced `origin/main` through `6b51e31`, preserve current main authorities while keeping the complete default-off coding profile and OAuth authorization-scoped runtime intact, pass all focused and root verification gates, refresh the existing PR #55, mark it ready and squash-merge it into `main`, then close the post-merge environment-key deny-policy P1 and archive the workflow without absorbing unrelated worktree state.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Apply the user-authorized post-merge closeout remediation: conservatively reject configured Coding MCP environment names containing `KEY`, `PASS`, or `AUTH`, add focused regressions for underscore-delimited and compact secret-shaped names, rerun external acceptance, and archive only after the P1 is cleared.
  - Preserve the user-selected 24-tool Coding profile surface (19 workflow/status tools plus five direct coding tools), correct bridge/operator documentation that incorrectly said only five tools were exposed, and add an exact tool-count regression without narrowing runtime behavior.
  - Apply the user-authorized external-review remediation: redact coding-tool failure text before audit persistence, serialize shared registry mutations so concurrent writers cannot lose an authorization-revision bump, add focused failure/concurrency regressions, and rerun external acceptance before archive.
  - Cherry-pick `0b80ef4`, `47cbe50`, `2f3405d`, `443f3ea`, `2a9d490`, `c3a77d1`, and `f3b546d` in order onto `origin/main@788ba60`.
  - Merge refreshed `origin/main@8e160323` and preserve its transactional TypeScript adoption cutover; regenerate derived current/handoff state rather than carrying the retired migration helper contract forward.
  - Merge refreshed `origin/main@bb750141` and preserve its independent BDD² evaluation foundation; regenerate derived current/handoff state rather than carrying either stale snapshot forward.
  - Merge refreshed `origin/main@02079da`; rename its BDD² V0 PRD to the required timestamped catalog shape, add only the missing `Draft` status metadata, and update its two direct references. Do not rewrite the PRD body or otherwise change BDD² product intent.
  - Merge refreshed `origin/main@3bf28a7` and preserve PR #58's newer BDD² authority: the retained V0 lives under `plans/archive/`, its reference points there, and the integration branch's temporary catalog repair must disappear from the final diff.
  - Merge refreshed `origin/main@6b51e31` and preserve PR #56's Bun 1.3.14 CI/runtime baseline and source-projection changes without introducing coding-MCP-specific compatibility paths.
  - Preserve current mainline removal of MCP rollout controls, candidate flags, and retired policy/type fields while layering the accepted coding-only profile, workspace/file/process tools, OAuth grant identity, docs, tests, and evidence.
  - Preserve the current Bun engine floor and add only the already-reviewed optional `node-pty` dependency; keep the lockfile deterministic.
  - Regenerate `tasks/current.md` and handoff/resume projections from the integrated state rather than selecting either stale side.
  - Run the focused MCP suites, full test suite, all root required checks, contract verification, and install/lockfile verification.
  - Push only the integration branch, reuse PR #55, require fresh green CI and a clean mergeability result, mark the PR ready, and squash-merge it into `main` after all gates pass. Preserve the local integration branch/worktree for post-merge inspection; do not publish or tag a release.
- Out of scope:
  - Redesigning the environment policy, adding secret-value inspection, changing the public Coding MCP tool contract, changing literal Ctrl-C input semantics, or broadening remediation beyond the three explicitly authorized P1 classes and their focused regressions.
  - Updating, stashing, committing, cleaning, or switching `/Users/kito/Projects/repo-harness` local main or its two WIP paths.
  - Reintroducing `scripts/mcp-rollout-gate.ts`, rollout flags, candidate-disabled semantics, or any policy surface retired by current `origin/main`.
  - Changing the accepted coding MCP public interface, adding compatibility fallbacks, publishing a release, tagging a version, deleting the integration worktree/branch, or changing Cloudflare/ChatGPT external state.
  - Redesigning, approving, implementing, or otherwise expanding the incoming BDD² V0 PRD.
- Taste constraints: replay commit patches rather than merge the stale branch tree; one current mainline policy authority, one OAuth authorization identity authority, no dual schemas, no unrelated cleanup.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.
- Stop if a conflict cannot preserve current rollout retirement and the accepted coding profile simultaneously without a new product decision.
- Stop before merge if the user-owned plan hash differs from the recorded preflight value. The generated `tasks/current.md` hash may advance only through an explicitly integrated main commit and its new value must be recorded before merge.

## Falsifier

The direction is wrong if replaying the seven commits necessarily requires a deleted rollout-control file/flag, or if focused MCP tests prove the coding profile cannot coexist with current mainline policy/setup semantics. Cheapest proof: cherry-pick the initial feature commit in isolation, inspect conflicts in the overlapping MCP authority files, and run focused policy/setup/HTTP tests before completing the remaining replay.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: current planner/orchestrator behavior remains on the post-cutover authority; coding remains explicit, default-off, grant/revision-bound, worktree-first, and usable across fresh MCP transports for one OAuth authorization.
- Edge cases: no retired rollout file/flag reappears; separate OAuth grants cannot share workspace/process state; Bun engine and optional `node-pty` coexist; derived workflow state is regenerated.
- Regression risks: conflict resolution could silently restore removed policy fields, drop coding security annotations, weaken grant isolation, or overwrite current adoption behavior.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: initial integration base `788ba60cca5e0072febc19833002a3ffe497b0a1`, refreshed main through `6b51e31d067e3718ca772231f51026cf5d2e4ab7`, source feature head `f3b546dc8ff9bb357f20d709aca51809cb3e3ad0`; local main generated-current hash after PR #56 `f5d30528c2bb225aadcb0171a7183e550b577ea563019b1b0b73cc47a0f0f735`; preserved user-owned plan hash `4c3aeda0ca8b82fa95da5c91cf2bc829ba8eddeb62f99e5468678fcc20e6a786`.
- Revert strategy: before merge, close PR #55 and preserve the isolated integration branch/worktree; after squash merge, revert only the PR #55 squash commit if required. Never alter the source feature branch or absorb unrelated worktrees.
