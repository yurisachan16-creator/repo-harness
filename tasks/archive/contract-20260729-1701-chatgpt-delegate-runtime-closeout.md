## Why

PR #135 currently claims a fail-closed delegate workflow, but independent acceptance proved that an allowed staged file containing a synthetic token reaches the generated `prompt.md`, and that the canonical delegate skill is absent from both host discovery roots. Shipping this state would expose repository secrets to an external browser and would still require a hand-written prompt to activate the workflow.

## Goal

Close both reproduced P1 gaps without creating a second protocol authority: add a required Gitleaks scan over the exact delegate PromptBundle before session/provider activity, and add an explicit owned projection of the canonical `repo-harness-chatgpt` package into Codex and Claude skill roots. Correct the PR evidence, rerun Canary B, and leave default install profiles unchanged.

## Scope

- In scope: ChatGPT browser egress scan and receipt; CLI plumbing; canonical skill source/projection lifecycle; tests; setup/delegate/browser-engine documentation; current plan/notes/review/todos/status evidence.
- Out of scope:
  - Oracle model/conversation metadata projection.
  - Default install-profile membership or MCP bridge behavior changes.
  - Automatic Gitleaks installation, browser/provider fallbacks, deployment, database work, or unrelated cleanup.
- Taste constraints: one canonical skill byte source; explicit opt-in projection; exact egress scan; missing scanner, findings, unowned destinations, and malformed sources all fail closed.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If Gitleaks cannot scan stdin without persisting/exposing the payload, if the scan occurs after provider/session side effects, or if the host projection requires copied independent protocol prose, stop and redesign before implementation. Cheapest proof: a synthetic-token fixture must fail before `.ai/harness/chatgpt/sessions/` exists, while an explicit host install must resolve through `realpath` to the canonical package.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

  manual_checks:
    - "A synthetic token in an allowed staged source file is rejected before session creation or provider launch, and neither stdout nor stderr contains the token"
    - "Explicit install makes repo-harness-chatgpt discoverable in both disposable Codex and Claude host roots by symlink to the canonical package; idempotent reinstall is a no-op and uninstall refuses unowned paths"
    - "Default minimal and full profile selectors still do not install repo-harness-chatgpt"
    - "Corrected Codex built-in-browser Canary B records the selected Pro label, conversation URL, exact trailing sentinel, and attachment result"
```

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: only a scan-passed delegate bundle may be persisted or submitted; explicit setup exposes one canonical skill to requested hosts.
- Edge cases: missing/incompatible scanner, scanner finding/error, repo-local Gitleaks config, synthetic allow comments, stale/unowned skill destinations, and idempotent install/uninstall.
- Regression risks: silently broadening ordinary consult behavior, loading repo-controlled scanner configuration, overwriting user skills, or reintroducing copied protocol authorities.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: PR #135 head `efef17c9ca263957217cbe1b044c8458fcc9d8d9` before the correction slice.
- Revert strategy: revert the single correction commit; no schema, default-profile, provider-state, or deployment migration is involved.
