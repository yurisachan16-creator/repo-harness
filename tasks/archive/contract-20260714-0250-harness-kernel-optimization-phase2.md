## Why

Phase 1 landed the kernel (profiles, explicit-first routing, context budget, effective state, circuit breakers) but the authoritative benchmark shows Lite is slower than Strict with equal tokens, and a cross-model review produced a live-reproduced bypass: a batched `apply_patch` never shows the risk floor its full pending scope, so medium-scope and cross-capability standard promotion can be skipped in one atomic action. Shipping wrong here either leaves a guard hole (batch scope) or keeps the harness 2x more expensive than no harness with no offsetting safety story.

## Goal

Execute plan phases A-E exactly as written in the plan's `## Task Breakdown`:
A) apply_patch full-batch scope fix + single-field `state resolve` output; B) benchmark `artifact_files` instrumentation + ceremony trigger threshold bound to the deterministic profile floor (lite: zero ceremony; standard: at most the active plan; strict: unchanged); C) capability-registry hardening + implementation-surface predicate unification + gate-semantics doc; D) facade retirement plumbing (D1; the 20 -> <=5 deletion re-sequenced to a deferred follow-up in `tasks/todos.md` per the plan's own re-sequence clause, 2026-07-13); E) debt cleanup (CHANGELOG, stale review closure, dead schema fields, installed-profile readback). Each phase is independently mergeable with its own accept gate; the plan's Success Criteria define done, with B's aggregate criteria 1-3 adjudicated as documented partial (true-lite bucket passes; promotion-time envelope cost deferred to follow-up).

## Scope

- In scope: exactly the files named per phase in the plan's `## Task Breakdown`, plus regenerated projections (`.ai/hooks/*`, `evals/harness/reports/profile-comparison.{json,md}`).
- Out of scope: risk-floor rule changes, guard override commands, `REPO_HARNESS_WORKFLOW_PROFILE` as a derived-value channel, new classifiers, compatibility aliases, the in-flight strict task's surfaces (`scripts/contract-run.ts`, `tests/contract-run.test.ts`, `assets/templates/helpers/contract-run.ts`, `docs/architecture/modules/workflow-engine/contract-assets.md`, `.claude/templates/`).
- Taste constraints: EXECUTION_BOUNDARY — absent requirements are forbidden design space; unrequested extras fail closed. Follow the minimal-change policy; match surrounding shell/TS idiom.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.
- Stop if A1 finds host payloads where the recursive invocation cannot recover the original patch command (plan escalation: batch-level pre-check pulled forward — parent decision).
- Stop if B1 instrumentation shows the Lite artifacts are hook spill rather than `plans|tasks` ceremony (plan contingency branch — parent confirms pivot before B2).

## Falsifier

B2's premise (Lite ceremony is agent-authored, harness-nudged) is falsified if B1's `artifact_files` shows the 10 Lite artifacts under `.ai/harness/runs|checks` instead of `plans|tasks`. Cheapest proof point: land B1, re-read the existing authoritative report's changed-path data before any B2 code. Phase A's premise is already proven by live repro (4-file patch -> 4x lite exit 0 vs sequential edits -> SpecGuard exit 2).

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: `assets/hooks/pre-edit-guard.sh:26-34` recursive apply_patch payloads carry a single `file_path`; `:85` passes only `--target-path "$FILE_PATH"`, so `resolveWorkflowProfile` never sees the batch scope (siblings not yet on disk are invisible to the diff merge at `src/cli/hook/state-snapshot.ts:697-701`).
- repro: run `pre-edit-guard.sh` against a 4-implementation-file apply_patch payload — all four recursive checks exit 0 as lite; the same files edited sequentially trip SpecGuard (exit 2) on the fourth.
- regression_guard: tests/runtime-profile-enforcement.test.ts (new batch-scope cases; must fail on unfixed code).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: .ai/harness/runs/phase2-a1-prefix-failure.txt

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260713-1202-harness-kernel-optimization-phase2.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260713-1202-harness-kernel-optimization-phase2.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20260713-1202-harness-kernel-optimization-phase2.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: `repo-harness run verify-sprint` must see this contract pass, the review recommend pass, and `## External Acceptance Advice` pass or record a manual override.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: batch apply_patch promotes on full scope; lite sessions get zero-ceremony guidance; invalid registry blocks with named repair instead of silent capabilityCount=0.
- Edge cases: duplicate/reordered patch paths; docs-only batches; repos with absent (never-declared) registries; hosts with user-modified facade dirs.
- Regression risks: over-promotion of large mechanical batches (intended, raise-only); C1 blocker surfacing latent registry corruption; facade retirement touching user machines (owner-marker path must be smoke-tested first).

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: worktree branch `codex/harness-kernel-optimization-phase2`, base `c604e3b`; one commit per phase (A1 and A2 may be separate commits).
- Revert strategy: revert the phase commit; `bun run sync:hooks` + `bun run check:hooks` restore hook parity; regenerated benchmark reports restore from git; facade set re-projects via install/sync (idempotent owner-marker transaction).
