## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass
- Change type: eval-only
- Intended files changed: E3 evaluation authority, tracked corpus, prompts/schemas,
  deterministic reports, PRD/Sprint/workflow closeout, and verification-only mainline
  integration repairs.
- Actual files changed: 36 files against `origin/main`; no public BDD skill, CLI/MCP,
  hook behavior, catalog, sidecar, lifecycle, generic linter, or Phase P surface.
- Commands passed: focused E3/integration tests, TypeScript, all three deterministic
  decision reproductions, full `bun test`, root required checks, and Claude cross-review.
- External acceptance: pass
- Residual risks: reviewer outcomes remain model judgments, but all source, packet,
  reviewer, adjudication, appendix, result, and historical-manifest authority is sealed
  and fail-closed.
- Reviewer action required: none
- Rollback: revert E3 commits and delete ignored E3 runs; Phase E/E2 evidence remains.

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: product-discovery-evaluation / eval-only Strict work-package.
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: plan records architecture map, immutable-output-to-gate trace, and
  scoring-only direct-cut rationale; notes record every pre-decision reseal and review fix.
- Root cause or plan evidence: Phase E2 interventions were reusable, while scoring
  authority was invalid; E3 changes only scoring authority and deterministic projection.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: equivalent complete diff review plus independent `claude-review`.
- Commands run:
  - `bun test` — 1216 pass, 1 skip, 0 fail, 10747 expects.
  - `bun test tests/run-bdd2-evals.test.ts tests/bdd2-evals-contract.test.ts tests/hook-dispatch-diet-report.test.ts tests/hook-contracts.test.ts` — 44 pass.
  - `bunx tsc --noEmit` — pass.
  - `bun scripts/run-bdd2-evals.ts validate` — E3 authority valid, 120 corpus rows.
  - `bun scripts/run-bdd2-evals.ts verify-evidence` for S3/EB3/EI3 — Kill/Kill/Kill reproduced.
  - `bash scripts/check-deploy-sql-order.sh` — pass.
  - `bash scripts/check-architecture-sync.sh` — blocking=0.
  - `bash scripts/check-task-sync.sh` — pass.
  - `repo-harness run check-task-workflow --strict` — pass.
  - `bun scripts/inspect-project-state.ts --repo . --format text` — no drift.
  - `bun src/cli/index.ts adopt --repo . --dry-run` — pass.
  - `repo-harness run verify-contract --contract tasks/contracts/20260713-0314-bdd2-phase-e3-scoring-authority.contract.md --strict` — 24/24 pass, Fulfilled.
- Manual checks: historical Phase E/E2 refs hash-valid; no new intervention output;
  I3 gated-not-run; Behavior Audit remains killed; no Phase P product surface.
- Supporting artifacts: `evals/bdd2/reports/phase-e3-gate.md` and three tracked E3
  evidence projections; ignored raw score runs remain locally validateable.
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/runs/bdd2/e3/`

## External Acceptance Advice

> **External Acceptance**: pass
> **External Reviewer**: Claude
> **External Source**: claude-review

- P1 blockers: none
- P2 advisories: none; dead correction-cost authority, stdin regression coverage, and
  two rebased integration assertions were resolved.
- Acceptance checklist: final E3 authority patch returned `No findings`; the separate
  integration test-only review also returned `No findings`, confirmed no assertion
  weakened the shipped runtime contract, rechecked all five earlier P1 fixes, and the
  full-history CI plus reachable-rebased-provenance follow-ups returned `No findings`.
  The final CI HOME-isolation follow-up resolved one notes-only P2 and then returned
  `No findings`; binding the source-tree circuit entry then resolved the runner-only
  failure and its corrected three-call scope also returned `No findings`. The final
  benchmark dry-run provider-isolation repair and deterministic profile-resolver
  failure fixture both returned `No findings` as well.

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Current product behavior does not change. E3 conclusively evaluates and rejects the
  current inline Shape, Browser Adapter, and ImageGen Adapter treatments.
- Browser screenshots and ImageGen prototypes remain important historical evidence,
  but neither adapter is approved as a product surface under the tested design.
- I3 did not run because its frozen prerequisite failed; Phase P remains unapproved.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- No active follow-up belongs to this Sprint. A future BDD² attempt requires a new
  product thesis and new intervention, not another scoring revision.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 9/10 | All three decisions reproduce from clean tracked authority. |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Terminal gate distinguishes evidence value from product approval. |
| Design quality | 9/10 | Single E3 authority; no E2 compatibility parser or Phase P surface. |
| Code quality | 9/10 | Fail-closed provenance, packet isolation, bounded transport, direct regression tests. |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: focused four-file test command, TypeScript, three `verify-evidence` commands,
  root required checks, and `bun test`.
- Re-check: `git diff origin/main...HEAD` contains no public BDD or Phase P surface.

## Summary

- Pass. E3 converts the inconclusive E2 scoring layer into terminal, reproducible
  Kill/Kill/Kill decisions, correctly gates I3, preserves historical evidence, and
  closes the Sprint without productization.
