## Why

`initCommandEnv` silently discards the entire `process.env` for the child invocation on the npx-cache path when the caller passes no env — PATH, HOME, proxy settings, and any `REPO_HARNESS_HOME` override are all lost. This is real user-facing behavior for npx-invoked `init`, and it was the one hole the test-home-isolation preload could not defend (init family kept leaking a registry entry per run until a test-side workaround). Skipped, the same base-dropping shape invites copies.

## Goal

`initCommandEnv` bases the constructed environment on `process.env` when the caller provides none; callers passing explicit env keep exact current behavior. A regression guard proves RED on unfixed code (artifact captured) and GREEN after. Sibling `...(env ?? {})`-style base-dropping shapes in `src/` are fixed or reported. Full suite, typecheck, and init dry-run green.

## Scope

- In scope: `src/cli/commands/init.ts` `initCommandEnv`; sibling base-dropping shapes found by the class sweep in `src/`; regression guard in `tests/cli/init.test.ts`.
- Out of scope: the bare-spawn explicit-env lint guard (separate slice), preload changes, `tests/` beyond the guard, behavior of callers that already pass env.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If some caller depends on the child seeing a minimal environment (deliberate sanitization), basing on `process.env` would be a behavior break — cheapest proof point: enumerate `initCommandEnv` callers and check none relies on the empty-base shape (the function's own guard clause returns caller env untouched when set, so only the no-env npx path changes).

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: `src/cli/commands/init.ts:194` — `initCommandEnv` returns `{ ...(env ?? {}), AGENTIC_DEV_LINK_INSTALLED_COPIES: "0" }` for an npx-cache source with no caller env, so the constructed child environment contains one key and `process.env` is discarded wholesale.
- repro: with `REPO_HARNESS_HOME` set in `process.env`, run an npx-cache-source `init` without passing env — the child resolves home via `homedir()` and writes to the real `~/.repo-harness` (observed as the init-family +1 registry leak per full-suite run that survived the isolation preload).
