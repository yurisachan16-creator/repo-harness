## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: canonical architecture queue helper, deterministic packaged projection, focused regression test, and workflow artifacts.
- Actual files changed: `scripts/architecture-queue.sh`, `assets/templates/helpers/architecture-queue.sh`, `tests/architecture-queue.test.ts`, plus this work-package's plan/contract/review/notes and `tasks/todos.md` projection.
- Commands passed: focused test (7 pass), helper projection check (52 helpers), full suite (2366 pass / 1 platform skip / 0 fail), and all remaining required repository checks; see Verification Evidence.
- Residual risks: nested workspace config/boundary files remain governed by the existing one-level medium-severity regexes; this slice intentionally fixes only registered nested `src/**` routing.
- Reviewer action required: typed AcceptanceReceipt from the contract-frozen Claude policy is still required before workflow fulfillment.
- Rollback: revert the classifier/resolver bridge, regenerate the packaged helper, and remove the focused regression fixture.

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: `hunt` for red-first diagnosis, then `check` with conditional architecture gate.
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: captured in the plan; the reviewed path is classifier → longest-prefix resolver → capability request card.
- Root cause or plan evidence: one-level workspace regexes returned `none unrelated`, causing the pre-resolver exit; red artifact is `.ai/harness/runs/nested-capability-architecture-routing/pre-fix.txt`.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: Codex gatekeeper first returned one MEDIUM finding on classified-path failure precedence; after the minimal fix and regression, read-only re-review returned PASS / NO FINDINGS.
- Commands run: `bun test tests/architecture-queue.test.ts`; `bun scripts/sync-helper-sources.ts --check`; `env -u REPO_HARNESS_NODE_BIN bun test --max-concurrency 4`; deploy SQL, architecture sync, task sync, strict task workflow, project-state inspection, and init dry-run checks.
- Manual checks: canonical/generated helper bytes match; `bash -n` passes for both; `git diff --check` passes; review subject has zero target overlap.
- Supporting artifacts: `.ai/harness/runs/nested-capability-architecture-routing/pre-fix.txt` and `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`.
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes.
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/runs/`.

- Summary: Claude external review passed with no P0/P1; five non-blocking P2 observations are recorded verbatim in substance.
- Findings: P2: Unrelated /src/ paths now fail closed if capability-resolver match fails; this is intentional under the repository no-fallback invariant, but changes the previous advisory exit behavior.; P2: Nested capability routing covers registered src paths only; nested package/config/boundary severity remains out of scope and is documented as residual risk.; P2: The source predicate accepts any src segment beneath the matched capability prefix, including nested fixture-style src directories.; P2: The promoted-source path with a missing architecture-event helper is not directly covered; classified-path advisory skip is covered.; P2: Previously unrelated src candidates incur capability resolver availability plus match process startup on the hook path.

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Registered nested `src/**` paths that were previously `unrelated` now become `low source-change` and route to the matched capability request. Unmatched paths still produce no request, and existing classified paths preserve the original advisory event-helper guard.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Nested `package.json`, route, and config severity generalization is out of scope; it needs a separately approved semantics decision if required.
- Formal workflow closeout remains blocked on the frozen Claude AcceptanceReceipt, not on implementation or repository checks.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 10/10 | Root repro and unmatched sibling both covered |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Uses canonical longest-prefix authority without root fallback |
| Design quality | 9/10 | Small classifier/resolver bridge; existing severity rules preserved |
| Code quality | 10/10 | Projection parity, focused regression, full required checks |

## Failing Items

- none

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test tests/architecture-queue.test.ts`
- Re-check: `bun scripts/sync-helper-sources.ts --check` and `bun src/cli/hook-entry.ts review-subject --target main --format json`

## Summary

- Implementation and architecture review pass. The code is ready for contract acceptance; formal fulfillment remains pending because the frozen policy requires a Claude-issued typed receipt.
