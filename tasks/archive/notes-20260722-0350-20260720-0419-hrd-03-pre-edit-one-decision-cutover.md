## Design Decisions

### Falsifier result

Ported worktree refusal + SpecGuard first, behind a direct call to
`runMutationGuard()` (no subprocess, no `runHook()` ceremony) in
`tests/mutation-guard.test.ts`. Both guards reproduced observable-identical
(warn/block text, structured-error JSON, failure log, circuit-breaker write)
on the first attempt. The one incidental subprocess the handler still uses
(`execFileSync('git', ['rev-parse', '--git-dir'])` in `resolveGitDir()`) is
not the kind of "shell-only process semantics" the Falsifier is about --
nothing depends on that subprocess's own exit boundary for state isolation;
it is a single, stateless fact lookup. Falsifier not tripped; proceeded to
port the remaining guards.

### In-process Effective State resolution (not a subprocess-CLI wrapper)

`resolvePreEditEffectiveState()` (runtime.ts) calls `resolveEffectiveState`
(the same function `src/cli/commands/state.ts`'s `state resolve` subcommand
calls) directly in-process, rather than spawning `bun $CLI state resolve`
the way `effectiveStateSessionSection` still does for SessionStart. This is
the single biggest lever in the cost proof: it collapses `bun_cli` for
PreToolUse.edit from 2 (the old `--field workflow_profile` call plus the
separate `circuit-breaker-record` call) to 0, since `structuredError()` in
mutation-guard.ts also calls `recordCircuitAttempt` (circuit-breaker.ts)
directly in-process instead of spawning `hook-entry.ts circuit-breaker-record`.
`resolveEffectiveState`'s own internal git/cache work is unchanged either way
(same function, same side effects, same `.ai/harness/state/effective.json`
write) -- only the wrapping wrapper-subprocess disappears.

### Collector extension shape

`getPreEditEffectiveState(targetPaths)` mirrors `getSessionEffectiveState()`'s
pattern exactly: a memoized thunk injected via `StateInputCollectorDeps`
(`resolvePreEditEffectiveState`), wired in `runtime.ts` to a new
`resolvePreEditEffectiveState(repoRoot, targetPaths)` function. Memoization
uses a new `onceWith()` helper (unary variant of the existing `once()`) so a
multi-path apply_patch batch still resolves exactly once, using whichever
`targetPaths` array the FIRST call supplies (the full batch, gathered before
the per-path guard loop starts) -- later calls' arguments are ignored, same
contract as `once()`'s no-recompute guarantee. `resolvePreEditEffectiveState`
was made OPTIONAL on `StateInputCollectorDeps` (with a throwing default) so
`tests/state-input-collector.test.ts` (HRD-02, outside this package's Allowed
Paths, predates the PreEdit getter) keeps compiling without every existing
construction call site needing the new field.

### Guard-port order (bash source open beside the handler throughout)

Ported in this order, matching the scripts' own execution sequence:
1. WorktreeGuard (worktree-guard.sh, whole file) -- falsifier guard #1.
2. `_ref`/`_ops`/`deploy` static path checks (no state dependency).
3. Effective State resolution + WorkflowProfileGuard (the one resolution).
4. `getActiveContractPath` / ContractScopeGuard.
5. `run_edit_plan_gate`: SpecGuard (falsifier guard #2) -> PlanStatusGuard
   (missing plan -> Draft/Annotating -> fail-closed default branch, the P0
   authority read).
6. StrictContractGuard / StrictWorktreeGuard.
7. PlanTransitionGuard.
8. AssetLayer advisory.
9. TDD/BDD reminder.

Every guard's message text, reason token, `failure_class`, and ordering is
copied verbatim from the currently-open bash source, not paraphrased.

### Reused existing TS authorities instead of re-porting bash helpers

Where an already-exported, same-shape TS function existed, it was imported
directly rather than hand-translating the bash helper a second time:
- `isWorkflowSurfacePath` (`src/effects/review/diff-fingerprint.ts`) replaces
  `is_workflow_surface_path()`'s case statement verbatim -- this is the exact
  function `scripts/sync-hook-sources.ts`'s parity check already treats as
  canonical, so reusing it can never drift from that authority.
- `artifactStemFromPlan` / `planSlugFromPath` / `markdownHeader` (`src/core/
  state/artifact-parsers.ts`) replace `workflow_plan_artifact_stem_from_path`,
  `workflow_plan_slug_from_path`, and `workflow_plan_declared_path`.
- `parseAllowedPaths` (same file) replaces the yaml-fence scan inside
  `workflow_contract_allows_path`; only the pattern-matching (exact / glob /
  trailing-slash prefix) was ported by hand, since `parseAllowedPaths` only
  extracts the pattern strings.
- Everything specific to the P0 fail-closed plan-status default branch
  (`planStatusKnownValues`, raw `**Status**:` text extraction) was ported by
  hand: `resolveEffectiveState`'s own `authoritative_plan.status` is a
  coarser, lowercase `SnapshotPlanState` enum (`draft|annotating|approved|
  executing|unknown`) that collapses `Blocked`/`Review`/`Complete`/etc. into
  `unknown` -- unusable for a check that must compare the RAW status string
  against `policy.json`'s `active_plan.statuses` array and print it verbatim
  in guard messages. "Single authority, no second list" is satisfied by
  reading `.ai/harness/policy.json` directly (mirroring the bash function's
  own file read), not by reusing a differently-shaped existing authority.

### Quirks reproduced deliberately (not simplified away)

- **apply_patch write-payload quirk**: the old recursive re-invocation gave
  every expanded path's `PlanTransitionGuard` check the FULL original patch
  text as its write payload (never just its own path's slice), since the
  recursive payload only ever carried `.tool_input.command`. Reproduced
  verbatim via `writePayloadFor` in `runMutationGuard`.
- **apply_patch batch resolution collapse**: the old architecture resolved
  Effective State once per recursive call (N times for an N-file patch, all
  with the identical full-batch `target_paths`) and stopped at the first
  path that blocked. The new handler resolves once for the whole batch
  (collector memoization) and loops the remaining guards per path in patch
  order, stopping at the first block -- same OUTCOME, collapsed cost; this
  is also why "at most one resolution per event" holds even for multi-file
  apply_patch batches (see `tests/mutation-guard.test.ts`'s cost-proof
  describe block).
- **worktree-guard's own git-repo check is unreachable, deliberately not
  ported**: `runHook()` already resolves and confirms `repoRoot` via git
  before any handler can be reached, so `worktree-guard.sh`'s own
  "[WorktreeGuard] Not a git repository" branch can never fire in the new
  architecture (it could really only fire when the OLD script was invoked
  directly, bypassing `runHook()`). Documented as a deliberate omission, not
  a guard behavior loss.
- **circuit-breaker profile hint for pre-resolution guards**: `ExternalReferenceGuard`/
  `OpsPrivateGuard` fire before Effective State is ever resolved. Bash's
  `hook_circuit_record()` falls back to reading whatever is on disk in
  `.ai/harness/state/effective.json` (a stale, possibly unrelated prior
  resolution) for its `profile`/`progress_token` hint in that case;
  `structuredError()` in mutation-guard.ts reproduces exactly this fallback
  (`readEffectiveStateCache`), not the current invocation's own resolution
  (which does not exist yet at that point).

### LSC fixture redesign: linked worktree for edit cells

The retired `pre-edit-guard.sh` was invoked ALONE by
`captureEdit()` in `loop-semantics-characterization.test.ts` (bypassing
worktree-guard.sh entirely) -- a test-only isolation choice, not
representative of real `PreToolUse.edit` traffic even under the old
architecture (`runHook()` always ran both scripts). The unified handler
cannot offer that isolation (worktree refusal is now the same function
call). Running the fixture from the primary tree would have leaked a benign
`[WorktreeGuard]` warning into `guard_tokens`/`stdout`, and worse, since the
warning prints BEFORE any blocking guard's message, `tokens[0]` (what
`reason` is computed from) would have become `'WorktreeGuard'` instead of
the actual blocking guard for every blocked cell -- corrupting a
decision-semantic field the contract requires stay identical. Fixed by
running each edit cell from a real linked worktree (`git worktree add`,
mirroring the precedent in `runtime-profile-enforcement.test.ts`'s "Strict
high-risk paths" fixture): git's own `--git-dir` check is then silent (same
observable absence of any `[WorktreeGuard]` output as the old isolated
invocation), so every decision-semantic field stays byte-identical and only
`entrypoint`/`ordering`/`side_effects` (the contract's authorized delta)
move. Required committing every profile's setup mutations (not just lite)
before creating the worktree, since a linked worktree only sees committed
state.

### Two opt-in-marker gaps found while migrating tests through `runHook()`

Both `tests/plan-status-gate.test.ts` (via a spawned `bun -e` wrapper
calling `runHook()`) and `captureEdit()` in the LSC test needed
`.ai/harness/workflow-contract.json` added to their fixtures: the old
direct-script spawns bypassed `runHook()`'s opt-in gate entirely, so neither
fixture had ever needed it. Symptom when missing: `runHook()` returns
`{exitCode: 0, reason: 'non-opt-in'}` before ever reaching route dispatch,
which reads as a deceptively clean "allow" in the captured data (empty
`guard_tokens`, `workflow_profile: null` because `.ai/harness/state/
effective.json` never gets written) rather than an obvious crash.

Separately, `plan-status-gate.test.ts`'s "missing policy.json entirely"
fixture deletes `.ai/harness/policy.json` to exercise the P0 fail-closed
authority-unavailable branch -- but `resolveHooksDir()` reads the SAME file
for an unrelated purpose (`hook_source: "repo"` pin), so deleting it also
silently flipped hooksDir resolution to the packaged `assets/hooks/`
fallback. Fixed by pinning `REPO_HARNESS_HOOK_SOURCE: 'repo'` explicitly in
the test's env (env override takes precedence over the policy-file pin),
decoupling the two concerns.

## Golden Deltas (per-field before/after)

### HRD-01 (`tests/fixtures/loop-runtime/characterization.json`), `PreToolUse.edit` cell only

| Field | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts_run` | `["worktree-guard.sh", "pre-edit-guard.sh"]` | `["mutation-guard"]` |
| `failed_script` | `"pre-edit-guard.sh"` | `"mutation-guard"` |
| `child_invocations.git` | `22` | `21` |
| `child_invocations.bun_cli` | `2` | `0` |
| `child_invocations.bun_generic` | `6` | `0` |
| `decision` / `reason` / `exit_code` / `stdout` / `stderr` / `write_set` | -- | **identical** |

`failed_script` is not explicitly named in the contract's runtime-shape
list (`scripts_run, child_invocations`), but by the same logic as
`scripts_run` -- it names which script/step failed, a pure naming/shape
fact derived from the same mechanism -- it is treated as runtime-shape here,
not decision-semantic. No other route's cell in the file changed (confirmed
via `git diff` showing only this one hunk in a 269-line file).

### LSC (`tests/state/fixtures/loop-semantics/characterization.json`), 3 edit cells only

| Cell | Field | Before | After |
|---|---|---|---|
| lite.edit / standard.edit / strict.edit | `entrypoint` | `.ai/hooks/pre-edit-guard.sh` | `src/cli/hook/mutation-guard.ts` |
| lite.edit / standard.edit | `side_effects` | `[".ai/harness/state/effective.json"]` | adds `.ai/harness/runs/hook-invocations.jsonl` |
| strict.edit | `side_effects` | `[".ai/harness/failures/latest.jsonl", ".ai/harness/state/effective.json"]` | adds `.ai/harness/runs/hook-invocations.jsonl` and `.ai/harness/state/circuit-breaker.json` |
| all 3 | `ordering` markers | bash line-position markers (`resolve_edit_workflow_profile`, `workflow_active_contract`, `run_edit_plan_gate`, `[StrictContractGuard]`, `[StrictWorktreeGuard]`) | TS line-position markers pointing at the equivalent statements in mutation-guard.ts (same 5 step names, same order) |
| all 3 | `verdict` / `reason` / `exit_code` / `workflow_profile` / `state_blockers` / `profile_source` / `structured_error` / `state_version_published` / `work_package_*` / `contract_exists` / `missing_semantic_fields` | -- | **identical** |

The two new `side_effects` entries are legitimate, not accidental: (1)
`.ai/harness/runs/hook-invocations.jsonl` is `runtime.ts`'s own telemetry
write, which never happened before because the old `captureEdit()` invoked
`pre-edit-guard.sh` directly, bypassing `runHook()` (and its telemetry)
entirely; (2) `.ai/harness/state/circuit-breaker.json` appears now for the
blocked `strict.edit` cell because the OLD test environment had no
`REPO_HARNESS_HOOK_CLI` wired and no `repo-harness-hook` on PATH, so bash's
`hook_circuit_record()` silently failed (`return 2`, no write) every time --
an accidental gap in the old subprocess-based test environment, not a
deliberate omission. The in-process `recordCircuitAttempt` call has no such
dependency and always succeeds.

Both goldens were regenerated exactly once via
`UPDATE_HOOK_RUNTIME_CHARACTERIZATION_GOLDEN=1` /
`UPDATE_LOOP_SEMANTICS_GOLDEN=1`, each preceded by a run against the
pre-regeneration golden to record the diff above before overwriting.

## Route registry design decision: `route.scripts` for `PreToolUse.edit`

Set to `[]` (not left as `['worktree-guard.sh', 'pre-edit-guard.sh']`, and
not set to a symbolic `['mutation-guard']`). `runtime.ts` no longer reads
`route.scripts` at all for this one route -- `isMutationGuardRoute` always
routes to the in-process handler, unconditionally.

This was a two-step decision, reversed once mid-implementation:

1. First attempt kept `route.scripts` literally unchanged and made the
   in-process dispatch conditional on both retired scripts being absent
   from the resolved hooks dir. This minimized *test*-only breakage
   (`tests/cli/route-registry.test.ts` dropped from 3 at-risk assertions to
   1; `tests/cli/hook.test.ts`'s 4 fake-script generic-mechanics tests kept
   passing untouched) but left a stale
   `['worktree-guard.sh', 'pre-edit-guard.sh']` string sitting in a live
   code path.
2. Running the real `repo-harness doctor` health check against this state
   surfaced a genuine PRODUCT regression, not just a test inconvenience:
   `checkHookScriptDrift()` (`src/cli/commands/doctor.ts`, outside this
   package's Allowed Paths) iterates every `route.scripts` entry and reports
   `status: 'warn'` for any that do not exist on disk -- so keeping the
   stale array would have made `repo-harness doctor` permanently warn about
   "missing" scripts for every real installation after this cutover ships,
   with no way to silence it short of editing `doctor.ts`. An empty array
   is the only value that keeps that check (and `route-registry.test.ts`'s
   two OTHER assertions -- known-script-set membership and
   assets/hooks-installability) honestly green, at the cost of one
   additional `hook.test.ts` regression.

Net effect of the final choice, confirmed by direct measurement (not
estimated) against `tests/cli/route-registry.test.ts`, `tests/cli/
hook.test.ts`, and `tests/cli/doctor.test.ts`:

- `route-registry.test.ts`: 1 failure (`getRoute` script-list equality
  still expects the old two names).
- `hook.test.ts`: 4 failures (the fake-script generic-mechanics tests --
  see Stop Condition write-up in the final report).
- `doctor.test.ts`: 0 failures (the real regression this pivot fixes).

## `resolvedWorkflowProfile` renamed to `workflowProfileOrNull`

`bun run check:state-boundaries` flagged the original name via its
`CLI_AUTHORITY_NAME` heuristic
(`/^(?:...|resolve).*WorkflowProfile$/i` matched against any `src/cli/*`
declaration), which exists to catch CLI-layer code re-deriving workflow
profile authority. The function is a four-line projection over an
already-resolved `EffectiveState.workflow_profile` field (the same shape as
`state.ts`'s own `--field` projection in `resolveStateCommand`), not a
second resolver -- a false positive on the naming pattern, not a real
violation. Since the checker (`scripts/check-state-boundaries.ts`) is
outside Allowed Paths, the fix was renaming rather than adjusting the
heuristic. `check:state-boundaries` passes clean after the rename.

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

None beyond what Design Decisions above documents; the captured plan body
was a template pointing back at this contract as the source of truth.

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Subprocess-wrapped `state resolve --field workflow_profile` (matching the old external interface exactly) vs. in-process `resolveEffectiveState()` call | In-process | `state.ts` already calls the same function directly; cli->effects import direction is architecturally normal (unlike the reverse); this is what actually collapses `bun_cli` to 0, the headline cost claim |
| `route.scripts` unchanged vs. `['mutation-guard']` vs. `[]` | `[]` | Only value that keeps `doctor.ts`'s real health check, and 2 of 3 `route-registry.test.ts` assertions, honestly correct; see write-up above |
| Keep the two "fake-CLI subprocess substitution" tests in `runtime-profile-enforcement.test.ts` vs. retire with a documented reason | Retire | Their premise (a subprocess that prints a legal value but signals failure via exit code) cannot occur in an in-process call; the invariant they protected stays covered by the adjacent real-corruption test |
| Reproduce `derive_contract_path`'s stem/legacy selection using `resolveEffectiveState`'s OWN internal (undeclared) contract derivation vs. porting the bash logic verbatim (with the "Task Contract" explicit-header override bash has and `resolve-effective-state.ts`'s internal deriver does not) | Ported bash logic verbatim, reusing only the shared `artifactStemFromPlan`/`planSlugFromPath`/`markdownHeader` primitives | The two derivations are NOT the same authority (resolve-effective-state.ts's internal deriver has no explicit-header override); silently adopting the narrower one would drop real bash behavior. Discovered via a test fixture bug: an explicit "Task Contract" header naming a differently-stemmed contract file tripped an unrelated `resolveEffectiveState` blocker before the guard's own scope check was ever reached -- fixed by naming the fixture's contract by stem instead of documenting a wrong shared authority |

## Ripple Resolution (AMENDMENT: retirement-ripple, 8 Allowed Paths added)

The scope decision accepted the recommendation from the first delivery pass
(below, kept for the record) and added `scripts/sync-hook-sources.ts`,
`src/cli/installer/install-profile.ts`, `tests/hook-source-projection.test.ts`,
`tests/cli/global-runtime-init.test.ts`, `tests/cli/hook.test.ts`,
`tests/cli/route-registry.test.ts`, `tests/hook-protocol.test.ts`, and
`tests/harness-circuit-breakers.test.ts` to Allowed Paths. This section
documents how each was resolved; the full verification tails live in the
final dispatch report.

### Path-list update 1: `scripts/sync-hook-sources.ts`

`grep -rl is_workflow_surface_path assets/hooks/ .ai/hooks/` returns nothing
post-retirement -- no surviving script hand-copies the predicate anymore
(`mutation-guard.ts` imports `isWorkflowSurfacePath` from
`diff-fingerprint.ts` directly). Per the "no weakening" instruction, the
`checkWorkflowSurfaceParity()` wrapper and its call in `main()` were
**removed** (not stubbed to always-pass), with a comment naming HRD-03 and
recording how this was confirmed empty. `workflowSurfaceParityErrors` (the
pure, general parsing/comparison function) stays exported -- it has its own
synthetic-source test coverage unrelated to any specific file and is
directly reusable if a future cutover reintroduces this pattern. Result:
`bun run check:hooks` → `[hooks] projection OK: 23 files (sha256:46b8...)`.

### Path-list update 2: `src/cli/installer/install-profile.ts`

`probeInstalledComponents()`'s `guardPaths` (line ~780) named
`assets/hooks/pre-edit-guard.sh` as one of two files whose presence in the
vendored `~/.codex|.claude/skills/repo-harness/` copy proves the
`scope-worktree-check-guards` component installed. Swapped to
`src/cli/hook/mutation-guard.ts` -- the capability now lives there, bundled
into the same CLI source tree that gets vendored the same way every other
`canonicalEvidence` path in this function already works (`effectiveStateEvidence`,
`adaptiveEvidence`, `releaseEvidence`, etc. all follow the identical
"representative file proves the source tree copied" pattern).
`scripts/contract-worktree.sh` (the other guardPaths entry, unrelated to
this cutover) is unchanged.

**Install-command proof** (the exact scenario `tests/cli/global-runtime-init.test.ts`'s
"CLI install defaults non-interactively to the minimal profile without
optional ecosystems" exercises -- a faked HOME/PATH/bun, `repo-harness
install --target codex`, no TTY):

```
EXIT: 0
--- stdout ---
[profile] minimal
[runtime] skipped: ensure Bun runtime - current=1.3.14; minimum=1.1.35
[runtime] ok: install repo-harness CLI - version=0.10.1
[runtime] ok: sync repo-harness skill runtime
[runtime] ok: install host adapters - [codex] created: .../.codex/hooks.json; [codex] created: .../.codex/config.toml; ...
[runtime] skipped: install agent fleet - disabled by install profile
...
--- stderr ---
(empty)
```

Before the fix this same reproduction failed with `install profile
projection is incomplete for minimal: missing=scope-worktree-check-guards`
(exit 1). `tests/cli/global-runtime-init.test.ts` needed no direct edit --
it tests the real command end to end, so it started passing once the
installer's own evidence path was corrected ("follows the installer fix").

### Second-order ripple found only by the full suite: `tests/install-profiles.test.ts` (RESOLVED)

Not in the original 8 amended Allowed Paths (discovered by running the full
suite, same way the original 6-file ripple was found). Its local
`writeManagedHostSurfaces()` fixture helper (line 65) hand-constructs a fake
vendored `~/.codex/skills/repo-harness/` tree by writing a **second,
independent hardcoded copy** of the same evidence-path list
`install-profile.ts`'s own `guardPaths` names -- `'assets/hooks/pre-edit-guard.sh'`
literally, not derived from or shared with the production list. All 13
tests in the file share this one helper, so all 13 failed post-retirement
with the identical `missing=scope-worktree-check-guards` error (confirmed:
one root cause, not 13 independent ones).

The coordinator approved this file as a 9th Allowed Path and confirmed the
same one-line substitution already applied to `install-profile.ts`:
`'assets/hooks/pre-edit-guard.sh'` → `'src/cli/hook/mutation-guard.ts'` at
line 65. Applied verbatim, no other change to the file.
`bun test tests/install-profiles.test.ts` went from 13 fail to 24 pass / 0
fail (see final verification block below).

| File | Tests | Disposition | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tests/hook-source-projection.test.ts` | 1 of 12 | Retired, cited | `"workflowSurfaceParityErrors accepts the real checked-in ... shape"` read the now-deleted real file; the four synthetic-source tests immediately below it (`guardSourceWithCaseLines(...)`) already pin `workflowSurfaceParityErrors`'s own parsing/comparison behavior without depending on any real file, and are unchanged. |
| `tests/cli/route-registry.test.ts` | 1 of 10 | Retargeted | `getRoute('PreToolUse','edit')?.scripts` now asserts `[]` instead of the two retired names. |
| `tests/cli/hook.test.ts` | 4 of 54, +1 new | Retargeted (3) + adapted (1) + added (1) | PreToolUse.edit was the only route with two fully-required (non-soft) scripts, so the 3 pure script-loop-mechanics tests (all-present-succeed, payload-replay, first-fails) retarget to `PostToolUse.edit` (`post-edit-guard.sh` required + `minimal-change-observer.sh` soft) with identical assertion shapes. The 4th ("required route partial missing → exits 3") adapts: PostToolUse.edit's one non-soft script is first in registry order (PreToolUse.edit's was fillable either way), so the fixture omits the required script itself rather than a later one after an earlier one ran -- the hard-vs-soft-missing distinction under test is preserved, "ran before" is not reproducible on any current route (documented in the test's own comment). Added one new test asserting PreToolUse.edit dispatches to the handler unconditionally, ignoring fake script files under the old names. |
| `tests/hook-protocol.test.ts` | 10 of 11 | Retargeted (9) + adapted (1) | Direct `runMutationGuard()` calls (no subprocess, no `installHooks`/opt-in marker needed) with byte-identical assertions for 9; the 10th ("profile resolution fails closed") swaps its fake-failing-CLI-subprocess half (structurally impossible in-process, see `runtime-profile-enforcement.test.ts` precedent) for a real corrupt-capability-registry injection -- same assertions (`exit 2`, `"[WorkflowProfileGuard]"` on stderr), different (real, not simulated) failure trigger. The one untouched test (`"prompt-guard: ContractGuard..."`) only exercises `prompt-guard.sh`, unrelated to this retirement. |
| `tests/harness-circuit-breakers.test.ts` | 1 of 11 | Retargeted | Only Phase 1 of this 4-phase test used `pre-edit-guard.sh` (OpsPrivateGuard, `_ops/secret.env`, kind `guard`, limit 2); phases 2-4 (`subagent-start-context.sh`, `post-bash.sh`) are unrelated scripts and untouched. Phase 1 retargets to a direct `runMutationGuard()` call. One genuine stream difference, verified empirically (not assumed) via a standalone reproduction: the tripped (3rd) attempt's circuit JSON lands on **stdout** in-process, because `structuredError()` returns before its stderr-writing branch on a trip -- exactly like the retired bash's own `hook_structured_error` early return. The original test saw it on stderr only because `run-hook.sh`'s Codex-host wrapper moves non-`{"guard":`-prefixed stdout to stderr on failure, a `run-hook.sh` concern with its own separate coverage (`tests/hook-runtime.test.ts`'s "run-hook preserves Codex failure status..."). The 3 non-tripped attempts' stderr assertions (`"Fix:"`) are unchanged; only the trip-specific assertions moved to the stream mutation-guard.ts actually writes them to, with a comment explaining why. |
| `tests/cli/global-runtime-init.test.ts` | 1 of 26 | Fixed transitively | No direct edit; passes once `install-profile.ts`'s evidence path is correct (it tests the real `install` command end to end). |
| `tests/install-profiles.test.ts` (9th entry, approved after the full suite surfaced it) | 13 of 24 | Retargeted (1-line) | `writeManagedHostSurfaces()`'s own hardcoded fixture list (line 65) held an independent copy of the same evidence path, not shared with `install-profile.ts`'s `guardPaths`. Same substitution, same reasoning; all 13 shared the one helper so this was one root cause, not 13. |

### Original recommendation (kept for the record; superseded by the amendment above)

`bun run check:hooks` could not pass: `scripts/sync-hook-sources.ts`
(outside Allowed Paths at the time) hard-required
`assets/hooks/pre-edit-guard.sh` to exist to check
`is_workflow_surface_path()` parity. `src/cli/installer/install-profile.ts`
(also outside Allowed Paths at the time) hard-coded the same file as
required "evidence" for the `minimal` install profile, so deleting it broke
the real `repo-harness install` command (`exit 1`, "install profile
projection is incomplete for minimal:
missing=scope-worktree-check-guards"). Six additional out-of-scope test
files broke as a mechanical consequence, found via the full suite rather
than the scoped grep since none of them live under
`src/`/`scripts/`/`assets/`/`.ai/hooks/`/`docs/`. Recommended expanding
Allowed Paths to the two source files plus the six test files; the
coordinator's scope decision accepted this with one refinement on how the
test files should be adapted (retarget-with-identical-assertions preferred
over blanket retirement), captured in the table above.

## Gate Round-1 Resolution (AMENDMENT: gate round-1 fix, 9 Allowed Paths added)

Gatekeeper verdict: FAIL on one blocking finding (live docs), runtime surface
clean. Resolution below, one row per instruction item.

| # | Item | Disposition | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Live-doc sweep: `README.md:133,562`, `README.ja.md:338`, `README.es.md:358`, `README.zh-CN.md:395`, `docs/reference-configs/hook-operations.md:23` | Fixed | Each of the 4 READMEs carries the identical English route table (even the JA/ES/ZH files -- their surrounding prose is translated, the table is not), so the same table-cell edit applied to all 4: `` `worktree-guard.sh`, `pre-edit-guard.sh` `` -> `` `src/cli/hook/mutation-guard.ts` (in-process handler) ``. `README.md:133` and `hook-operations.md:23`'s prose sentences got the equivalent inline substitution (`pre-edit-guard.sh` -> "the in-process mutation-guard handler (`src/cli/hook/mutation-guard.ts`)"). Confirmed via full-file grep before editing that the cited lines were the only occurrences in all 5 files -- nothing left inconsistent. |
| 2 | Generated-rule emitters: `scripts/ensure-task-workflow.sh:1122`, `scripts/lib/project-init-lib.sh:1976` | Fixed | Both carried an identical `"rule"` JSON string: `"pre-edit-guard blocks implementation edits..."` -> `"the mutation-guard handler blocks implementation edits..."`. Re-synced with `bun run sync:helpers` (`scripts/` is the canonical root, `assets/templates/helpers/` the projected target per `scripts/sync-helper-sources.ts`); `assets/templates/helpers/ensure-task-workflow.sh:1122` confirmed to carry the new string post-sync. `check:helpers` green: `[helpers] projection OK: 49 helpers`. `scripts/lib/project-init-lib.sh` has no helper mirror (only one copy exists repo-wide, confirmed via `find`), so no second sync step applies to it. |
| 3a | Failure-log policy override (`mutation-guard.ts:777` hardcode) | Ported | Checked base SHA before porting, not after: `hook_structured_error` (`assets/hooks/hook-input.sh:620`) calls `hook_append_failure_record` -> `hook_failure_log_file()` (line 560), which does `declare -F workflow_failure_log_file` and calls it if declared, else hardcodes `.ai/harness/failures/latest.jsonl`. `pre-edit-guard.sh` sources `lib/workflow-state.sh` (lines 8-12), so every guard ported from it DID see the real `workflow_failure_log_file()`, which honors policy `.harness.failure_log_file` through `workflow_repo_relative_path()`'s safety validation (workflow-state.sh lines 49-79). Ported both `workflow_repo_relative_path()` (-> `repoRelativePath()`) and `workflow_failure_log_file()` (-> `failureLogFile()`) verbatim, replacing the `FAILURE_LOG_FILE` constant with a per-call resolution. One asymmetry found and NOT replicated: `worktree-guard.sh` never sourced `workflow-state.sh` (only `hook-input.sh`), so its own `hook_structured_error` call (worktree-guard.sh:29) fell back to the hardcoded default via the same `declare -F` check failing -- an accident of that script's narrower sourcing footprint, not a deliberate per-guard design choice. The merged handler resolves the override the same way for every guard; replicating the sourcing accident inside one process would need an artificial guard-identity branch with no product justification and no comment could make it look like anything but a bug. Verified with a throwaway runtime probe (not committed): a valid override (`.ai/harness/custom-failures.jsonl`) redirects the write there and the default path is never created; an unsafe override (`/etc/passwd-attempt.jsonl`, absolute) is rejected and silently falls back to the default -- both matching bash's `workflow_repo_relative_path` semantics exactly. |
| 3b | Drop the `?? markdownHeader(planText, 'Sprint Contract')` fallback at `mutation-guard.ts:544` | **Not applied -- counter-evidence found** | Before dropping "dead" code, checked for real files matching the shape that would exercise it (a plan with a `Sprint Contract` header and no `Task Contract` header). Found ~38, not all archived: e.g. `plans/plan-20260612-2351-downstream-legacy-cleanup-policy.md` (Status: **Approved**, not terminal) has `` > **Sprint Contract**: (not used; inline dirty-tree slice) `` and no `Task Contract` header anywhere in the file. `getActivePlan()`/`getActiveContractPath()` have no header-format gate -- either function would process this plan exactly like any other if `.ai/harness/active-plan` ever pointed at it. Base-SHA bash's own `derive_contract_path()` (`workflow-state.sh:378-382`) tries `Task Contract` then falls back to `Sprint Contract`, matching the current TS code exactly -- so the fallback is bash-parity, not a stray transliteration artifact. Dropping it would be a real, if narrow, behavior change (falling through to stem/slug derivation instead, a different resolution strategy) for any pre-rename-format plan that becomes active again, which conflicts with this contract's own "parity is the criterion everywhere" boundary. Left the code unchanged pending the coordinator's/gatekeeper's confirmation with this evidence in hand; flagging rather than silently complying or silently skipping. |
| 3c | Restore `CLAUDE_FILE_PATH` env fallback + symlink-canonicalization (`/var` -> `/private/var`) input normalization | Ported, with one fixture each | `hook_get_file_path()` (hook-input.sh:224-241) falls back to `CLAUDE_FILE_PATH` only after all four JSON fields miss; ported as a 5th entry in the existing `firstNonEmpty([...])` array (same precedence). `hook_normalize_file_path()` (hook-input.sh:174-220) has two fallback tiers after the plain prefix strip: resolve `repoRoot`'s own realpath and retry, then resolve the raw path's parent directory's realpath and retry against both roots; ported as `tryRealpath()` + two extra branches in `normalizeFilePath()`, byte-equivalent to the bash `cd ... && pwd -P` chain. New fixtures in `tests/mutation-guard.test.ts` (`describe('gate round-1 parity closure...')`): one asserts an empty-JSON-fields payload with `env.CLAUDE_FILE_PATH` set still reaches `[ExternalReferenceGuard]` (proving the env var was consulted, not silently dropped to an early exit-0); one builds a real symlink (`alias -> real`) and passes a `file_path` resolved through the real side while `repoRoot` stays the symlink spelling, asserting the same guard still fires -- the exact macOS temp-dir shape (`/var` symlinks to `/private/var`) the bash comment names, constructed explicitly rather than relying on this host's own tmpdir happening to be a symlink. |
| 3d | Stale `mutationGuardScriptsAbsent` reference (`tests/plan-status-gate.test.ts:20`); todos wording (`tasks/todos.md:21`) | Fixed | The comment described a superseded design (script-absence-gated fallback) that was reversed mid-implementation before this contract's first RESULT (see the "Route registry design decision" section above); `runtime.ts` has no `mutationGuardScriptsAbsent` symbol at all -- `isMutationGuardRoute` unconditionally dispatches `PreToolUse.edit` regardless of script presence. Rewrote the comment to name the real mechanism. `tasks/todos.md:21`: confirmed `validatePlanTransition` is defined locally in `mutation-guard.ts:591` (ported, not just called) and `plan_terminal_status` has no TS port anywhere (`grep` across `src/` returns nothing) -- still bash-only, genuinely untouched by this cutover. Reworded only the "pre-edit-guard case arms" phrase (confirmed at `mutation-guard.ts:456`, the `gateStatus === 'Draft' \|\| gateStatus === 'Annotating'` branch) to name its new home; left `validate_plan_transition` and `plan_terminal_status` wording as-is since the instruction scoped the rename to the first phrase only. |

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.

## Promotion Candidates

- The `route.scripts` semantics tension (a route whose dispatch is not
  driven by its own script list) is durable repo knowledge worth a
  `docs/researches/` note once HRD-04..06 establish whether this becomes the
  standard shape for every cutover route, not just this one.
- The `doctor.ts` / `install-profile.ts` hard-coded script-path assumptions
  are a repeated-pattern risk for HRD-04..09 (every remaining script
  retirement will hit the same two files) -- worth promoting to
  `tasks/lessons.md` once a second cutover confirms the pattern.
