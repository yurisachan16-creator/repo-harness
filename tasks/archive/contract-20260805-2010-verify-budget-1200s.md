## Why

The whole-round verification budget (`VERIFICATION_BUDGET_MS=600000`) has been outgrown by the repo's own required `bun test` (2202 tests, 498-597s measured; three deadline kills at 595-597s on 2026-08-05, snapshots in `.ai/harness/runs/`). Any code-change contract whose `commands_succeed` includes `bun test` — including the currently blocked hook-entry-single-file-bundle shipment — cannot complete `verify-sprint`. Skipped: every future full-suite contract deadlocks at the gate. Shipped wrong (e.g. env-overridable budget): the gate becomes relaxable per invocation and stops being a fixed policy line.

## Goal

The verification budget constant reads `1200000` in BOTH copies of the helper (`scripts/verify-contract.sh:5` and its byte-identical projection `assets/templates/helpers/verify-contract.sh:5`), the test that pins the constant (`tests/unit/verifier-evidence-lifecycle-cutover.test.ts:123`) asserts the new value, and a new drift-check test pins byte-equality of the scripts/ ↔ assets/templates/helpers/ projection pairs that are identical at baseline. Deadline semantics, fail-closed kills, and all other gate behavior unchanged.

## Scope

- In scope: the budget constant in both helper copies; the pinned assertion in `tests/unit/verifier-evidence-lifecycle-cutover.test.ts`; one new drift-check test under `tests/unit/` asserting byte-equality for helper files present in both `scripts/` and `assets/templates/helpers/` that are byte-identical at baseline (measure first; report any baseline-divergent pairs instead of asserting them).
- Out of scope: env-override mechanisms for the budget, per-command budgets, any other line of the helpers, `~/.zshenv` machine config, `bun test` runtime itself.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If a full verify round under ambient load still exceeds 1200s, the budget diagnosis is incomplete (the suite or load, not the constant, is the pressure point). Cheapest proof: the blocked hook-entry-single-file-bundle worktree's `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance` completing after this change merges.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260805-1950-verify-budget-1200s.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260805-1950-verify-budget-1200s.review.md`

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior:
- Edge cases:
- Regression risks:

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: worktree branch `codex/verify-budget-1200s` off `699bc70c`
- Revert strategy: revert the single commit; the constant returns to 600000. No other behavior involved.
