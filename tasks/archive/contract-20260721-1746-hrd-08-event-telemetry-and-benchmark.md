## Why

The runtime currently emits independent per-script lines that cannot be joined safely into a host event and the diet report therefore claims no runtime evidence. Without one event authority, LOOP-12 latency/process/state/write budgets cannot be measured reliably, concurrent events can be mis-grouped, and HRD-09 would retire scripts without a trustworthy before/after runtime baseline.

## Goal

Write exactly one structured telemetry record per eligible host hook event, cut every live consumer from the retired per-script log to that record, and commit a reproducible JSON/Markdown report with valid sample counts, p50/p95, coverage, and explicit results for every LOOP-12 target.

## Scope

- In scope: an event-scoped telemetry protocol and writer; instrumentation at the existing route/state/PostEdit/Stop boundaries; one-shot authority cutover in the diet report and profile benchmark reader; targeted tests; characterization fixture update for the intentional telemetry write-set change; architecture/runtime docs; a measured local baseline-vs-target report.
- Out of scope: changing route registration or user-visible hook decisions; retiring legacy scripts (HRD-09); OS syscall/process profiling; optimizing failed targets merely to make the report green; provider-backed benchmark matrices; provider review calls during measurement; hook asset/source projection changes; EPC or SSD work.
- Taste constraints: fail closed when evidence is missing or incomplete, keep hook execution fail-open when non-authoritative telemetry append fails, never infer hidden legacy-script I/O, and do not retain a reader/writer fallback for `hook-invocations.jsonl`.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if a required target can only be claimed through OS-level syscall/process measurement rather than the approved logical/direct-runtime metric definitions.
- Stop if one event cannot be finalized centrally without changing host-visible hook decisions or error behavior.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

The direction is wrong if a focused fixture shows that a single host invocation can bypass the central `runHook` finalization boundary, or that a named LOOP-12 metric required for PreEdit/PostEdit/Stop is observable only inside an opaque legacy shell script. The cheapest proof is a route fixture covering success, blocked, and error returns plus target-specific coverage assertions before changing report semantics.

## Root Cause Evidence

Not applicable: this is an instrumentation work-package, not a bugfix profile.

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: one event record covers every eligible handled route result; the report uses only event records and provides measured p50/p95 plus all named LOOP-12 thresholds.
- Edge cases: blocked/error routes still finalize once; malformed, empty, mixed-protocol, or target-incomplete evidence cannot produce `available: true`; telemetry writer failure preserves the hook result.
- Regression risks: instrumentation must not change hook decisions, route order, Stop atomicity, or internal `git`/`bun` characterization counts. The only expected characterization write-set change is from the retired per-script JSONL to the new event JSONL.
- Authority cutover: no production writer or reader may reference `.ai/harness/runs/hook-invocations.jsonl`; no compatibility parser or migration path is allowed.
- Measurement boundary: direct runtime-dispatch children and logical observed files are distinct from OS process/syscall counts; telemetry self-writes are excluded.
- Evidence boundary: generate the committed local report once after code freeze with at least 20 fixture iterations; record actual failures rather than expanding scope to optimize them; do not run the full provider-backed profile matrix.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: pre-change branch base `e1fce20a73bea1df197ac5dba3270fbf43eb26b3`.
- Revert strategy: revert the single HRD-08 PR commit(s). The ignored event telemetry cache is non-authoritative and may be deleted locally; no compatibility reader or data migration is required.
