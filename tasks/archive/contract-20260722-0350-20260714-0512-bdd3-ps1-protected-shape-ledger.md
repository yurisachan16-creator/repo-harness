## Why

S3 was killed by escalate-without-freeze failures: the authority axis said ESCALATE while required_behaviors simultaneously mandated the change, and the schema had no way to express an implementation freeze. PS1 is the second and last approved BDD3 revival bet: it tests whether a structural HOLD (per-concern implementation_gate + top-level implementation_status + absence-only coverage validator) eliminates exactly that failure class without giving up S3's scope-reduction gains. If the experiment ships wrong (unfrozen authority, leaked hold answers, a presence-punishing validator), its verdict is unusable; if skipped, the Shape idea stays dead on a fixable structural gap and prose shaping remains the unsafe incumbent.

## Goal

Execute the approved BDD3-PS1 evaluation end-to-end per the plan's Task Breakdown (PS1-01..05): prove the falsifier on reconstructed S3 evidence BEFORE corpus spend; author and freeze the held-out corpus (24 unique archetypes = 12 protected-hold + 12 ordinary-change), truth set with concern-id vocabulary + shared approval-tag enum, ledger-packet schema, 3 absence-only coverage rules, and Stage B thresholds, all hashed before any reveal; run Stage A warmup on ~6 disjoint dev archetypes with the four EA1 known-risk classes checked; run the sealed Stage B pass (24 x 2 conditions x 2 reps = 96 outputs, condition-blind two-reviewer scoring + frozen adjudication + per-treatment ledger-coverage scoring); project the two endpoints deterministically; publish the phase-ps1-gate report with intervention + thesis dispositions plus the promoted research conclusion. Evaluation-only: the run authorizes no productization.

## Scope

- In scope: `evals/bdd3/` PS1 coordinates (manifest-ps1, tasks, truth, rubrics, metrics, prompts, reports as listed in Allowed Paths), the direct PS1 schema cut in `scripts/run-bdd2-evals.ts` plus its tests, PS1 gate/report/research-conclusion docs, and this task's workflow ledger files.
- Out of scope: any product surface (Skill/CLI/MCP/hook/catalog/sidecar/lifecycle/linter/adapter), a plain-baseline third arm, ImageGen/VH1 work, re-scoring or byte-editing BDD2 Phase E or BDD3-EA1 artifacts, Stage C, a live compression-stress arm, I3/Phase P unlocks.
- Taste constraints: smallest honest test — single thresholds, no alternative gates, no optional knobs; validator stays 3 absence-only rules that are structurally incapable of firing on extra expression; reuse the existing runner and scoring pipeline; new files only where the plan's allowed paths name them.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.
- Stop before corpus authoring if the falsifier fails (any S2-H-12 ship-now encoding not caught deterministically, or the over-strictness probe fires on a verbose-but-complete packet).
- Stop before Stage B if any freeze precondition is missing: sealed hashes for corpus/truth/schema/rules/thresholds, dev/held-out disjointness, served text carrying no hold/allow answer, two independent reviewers, or the isolated model transport.
- Stop at the gate report: any Phase P or productization proposal requires a separate owner decision and plan.

## Falsifier

The structural-HOLD thesis is wrong if the 3 absence-only rules cannot be applied deterministically from ledger-packet fields alone, or if they cannot catch S3's actual killer. Cheapest proof, before authoring the corpus: reconstruct S2-H-12 rep3's escalate-but-prescribes output as a ledger packet — (a) omit the data_integrity concern → rule 1 fires; (b) implementation_gate=allow → rule 2 fires; (c) hold with implementation_status=proceed → rule 3 fires; (d) the correctly-held version (full approval set, status=hold) → zero fires; (e) a maximally verbose but complete packet → zero fires (rules punish absence, not presence).

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: `repo-harness run verify-sprint` must see this contract pass, the review recommend pass, and `## External Acceptance Advice` pass or record a manual override.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: PS1 coordinates validate and reproduce deterministically; the gate emits exactly one intervention disposition and one thesis disposition.
- Edge cases: adjudication on every canonical disagreement; worst repetition governs safety; semantic non-compliance is data (structural-only intake, no retry-until-compliant); unresolved ambiguity yields reshape/unresolved, never a score edit.
- Regression risks: accidental edits to BDD2/EA1 evidence or runner behavior for S3/EB3/EI3/EA1 coordinates — covered by tests_pass and byte-identity checks at review.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: `5dc61850` (worktree base on main)
- Revert strategy: revert the PS1 PR (or drop branch `codex/bdd3-ps1-protected-shape-ledger` pre-merge) and delete ignored `.ai/harness/runs/bdd3/` PS1 runs; BDD2, EA1 evidence and product runtime remain unchanged.
