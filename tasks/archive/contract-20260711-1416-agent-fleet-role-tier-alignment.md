## Why

The installed `fast-worker` was intentionally moved to Sol/high, but the repo generator still projects upstream `sonnet/max` to Terra/medium. A forced fleet reinstall would restore the rejected execution tier.

## Goal

Make repo-harness deterministically generate and install the Codex `fast-worker` as `gpt-5.6-sol` with `high` reasoning and `workspace-write` sandboxing, while preserving the existing Claude source and explicitly leaving native V2 runtime role selection out of scope.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Generator and mirrored template mapping.
  - Golden Codex `fast-worker` TOML.
  - Exact tests and operator docs that project the mapping.
  - Workflow artifacts and local installed-host verification.
- Out of scope:
  - Native V2 `agent_type`/model routing or claims that this change fixes it.
  - Managing a fourth explorer file through the Fable fleet.
  - Claude source edits, delegation triggers, CLI upgrades, provider/auth changes, or aliases.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop if the change requires altering Claude agent semantics.
- Stop if script/template parity cannot remain exact.
- Stop if a required edit falls outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if generated output differs from the committed golden after the focused test.

## Runtime Boundary

This contract changes the desired installed fleet artifact only. The separate blocked contract `tasks/contracts/20260711-0219-codex-native-role-model-override.contract.md` remains authoritative for the unresolved GPT-5.6 V2 runtime role-selection limitation.

### Corrective Scope Expansion

External ship acceptance proved that the role-identity correction requires a
real Bun runtime floor and that the package bootstrap paths must enforce it.
The ongoing user instruction to continue this closeout authorizes the five
additional paths above solely for runtime-floor enforcement across shell,
PowerShell, and CLI-driven public bootstrap/update entrypoints, their regression
tests and localized install guidance, and the correction-derived lesson; native
role routing remains out of scope.

## Delegation Contract

```yaml
delegation:
  roles:
    parent:
      mode: narrate_and_gatekeep
      purpose: implementation_and_closeout
  runner:
    preferred:
      - main-thread
    fallback: main-thread
    brief_is_authoritative: true
```

## Exit Criteria (Machine Verifiable)

```yaml
exit_criteria:
  files_contain:
    - path: scripts/install-agent-fleet.sh
      pattern: 'model: "gpt-5.6-sol"'
    - path: .codex/agents/fast-worker.toml

    - path: .codex/agents/fast-worker.toml
      pattern: 'sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"'
    - path: tests/install-agent-fleet.test.ts

  commands_succeed:

    - bash scripts/migrate-project-template.sh --repo . --dry-run
  manual_checks:
    - "Forced local fleet install yields Sol/high fast-worker and leaves explorer Terra/medium"
    - "Review does not claim native V2 per-role runtime selection is fixed"
```

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: `d25bc6dbdaf1124799f876357c90b5c96534c950`
- Revert strategy: revert this work package and rerun the previous fleet installer with `--force`.
