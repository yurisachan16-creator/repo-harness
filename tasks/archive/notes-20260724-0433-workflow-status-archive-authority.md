## Design Decisions

- The policy keeps `active_plan.statuses` as the ordered known-value authority
  and adds four lifecycle anchors. Consumers project pre-approval and terminal
  subsets from that ordered array; the anchors must be adjacent/ordered and
  every anchor must resolve inside the array or all consumers fail closed.
- Historical evidence is never an implicit fallback from stale current checks.
  Operators must select `archive-workflow --evidence-mode sealed-terminal`;
  default `current` mode retains the existing checks + AcceptanceReceipt path.
- The sealed predicate is shared by the classifier and archive helper and is
  exact: contract header `Fulfilled`, review `Recommendation: pass`, and a
  structurally valid typed `Acceptance Receipt Projection` with bound identity,
  subject, target, verification hash, and issue time.
- The 61-plan historical population produced zero AUTO rows. This is a valid
  fail-closed result, not a reason to reinterpret `Done`/`Active`, accept legacy
  External Acceptance prose, or synthesize receipts. No historical artifact was
  moved; the current package plan is the single EXCLUDE row.

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

- The approved sweep archived zero plans because none satisfied all three
  sealed-terminal conditions. The package still completed the full 61-row
  classification and implemented the owner-selected archive model.

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Treat contract `Done` as `Fulfilled` | Rejected | The owner-approved model named exact `Fulfilled`; semantic translation would be unauthorized compatibility behavior. |
| Treat old `External Acceptance: pass` prose as a typed receipt | Rejected | It lacks the receipt identity and binding fields and would synthesize authority. |
| Automatically fall back from current checks to sealed history | Rejected | Explicit evidence mode keeps live and historical closeout semantics observable and fail closed. |

## Open Questions

- None.

## Evidence Links

- Checks: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Classification JSON: `.ai/harness/runs/20260724-0324-workflow-status-archive-authority/classification.json`
- Classification TSV: `.ai/harness/runs/20260724-0324-workflow-status-archive-authority/classification.tsv`

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.

## Promotion Candidates

- Promote to `tasks/lessons.md` only after a repeated correction or failure pattern.
- Promote to `docs/researches/` only when it is durable repo knowledge with evidence.
- Promote to harness asset files only after verification across more than one task or fixture.

## Historical Classification Audit

- Root plans scanned: 62.
- Current package excluded: 1.
- Historical plans classified: 61.
- AUTO: 0; HOLD: 61; EXCLUDE: 1.
- Apply result: no historical moves.

## Final Gate Correction

- The first frozen `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance` run failed three rows.
- The hook source change had correctly regenerated `.ai/hooks/.projection.json`,
  but the generated marker was not yet committed or declared in `allowed_paths`;
  this also made `check-task-sync.sh` see an unsynchronized worktree-only change.
- `bun src/cli/index.ts adopt --repo . --dry-run` is a required root check but
  `verify-contract.sh` deliberately rejects every `adopt` command as an evidence
  producer. It is therefore retained as an explicit manual check and executed
  once outside the contract verifier, rather than weakened or disguised.
- Manual result: exit 0, `0 total, 0 planned, 0 skipped`, with the expected
  self-host warning that downstream adopt is not applicable.
- The focused `bun test --bail` diagnosis found the full-suite failure in
  `tests/skill-surface/retired-names-scan.test.ts`: the new classifier uses
  the permanent AcceptanceReceipt source enum values `codex-review` and
  `claude-review`, which the retired Skill-name sweep intentionally permits
  only in its exact provenance-enum file list. Both synchronized classifier
  copies are now listed there; no routing alias or compatibility spelling was
  introduced.
- The second frozen gate passed every root check except `bun test` and the
  manual-evidence projection. The manual command was already green; its exact
  checked review projection is now recorded. The remaining full-suite failure
  occurs after the retired-name scan and is captured in the final diagnostic
  run log before the third and last gate.
- The captured diagnostic full suite then passed: 2053 pass, 1 skip, 0 fail
  in 494.75 seconds. Its SHA-256 is
  `12912e10c668ba818b9706aae5dd70e6db50104d761ffab6968f10fbb008dfb8`.
  Per the no-duplicate-expensive-evidence rule, the final contract gate treats
  that frozen-source run as exact checked manual evidence and verifies the log
  artifact instead of running the same eight-minute suite a fourth time.
- The final prepare gate then reached ContractVerify 14/14; its sole outer
  failure was an omitted exact allowed path for
  `src/core/adoption/standard-plan.ts`, already part of the committed policy
  projection change. The contract now declares that real scope explicitly.
- Final prepared verification passed with ContractVerify 14/14, review pass,
  allowed paths pass, and authoritative `checks/latest.json` materialization.
  Codex recorded an `external_pass` receipt with no findings; finalization
  reused the prepared evidence without rerunning tests.
