## Why

The host install surface has four names but only three hook sizes. The approved
contract is now exactly two profiles: `minimal` is 7 hooks, `full` is 11 hooks,
the old 5-hook tier is retired, and `full` is the default. Because protocol-1
`minimal` means 5 hooks, changing its meaning without a schema boundary would
silently reinterpret installed state.

## Goal

Ship a protocol-2, two-profile host runtime. Fresh and adapter-only installs
default to full. Minimal projects the former standard baseline and 7 Codex
hooks; full projects the union of former product-planning and strict surfaces
and 11 hooks. Legacy protocol-1 state is rejected by normal paths and can be
replaced only through an explicit, transactional migration action.

## Scope

- Replace install and skill-surface profile vocabularies with `minimal|full`.
- Remove the 5-hook managed projection.
- Make status/setup health profile-relative at 7/7 and 11/11.
- Merge the former product and strict components/facades/provider skills into full.
- Bump persisted installed state to protocol 2.
- Add explicit protocol-1 migration, with ownership validation, rollback, and
  no protocol-1 rollback history in the new state.
- Update current source tests and current operator/architecture/audit docs.

Out of scope:

- Repository workflow profiles (`lite|standard|strict`), adoption modes,
  historical/frozen eval output, archived workflow artifacts, and actual
  operator HOME mutation.
- ChatGPT integration remains explicit-only.
- No aliases or fallback parsing in steady-state paths.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop if implementation requires changing workflow-profile semantics.
- Stop if a migration would delete unowned files or entire shared host config.
- Stop if a required path is outside `allowed_paths`; amend this contract first.
- Stop after three fix/reverify rounds for the same issue.

## Falsifier

The direction is wrong if full cannot deterministically contain both former
product-planning and strict surfaces. The cheapest proof is catalog/profile
projection tests plus a disposable-HOME full install and state readback.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Exact steady-state vocabulary is `minimal|full`.
- Exact Codex hook counts are 7 and 11.
- Full is default and is the union profile; minimal is intentionally bounded.
- Protocol 1 fails closed outside explicit migration.
- Migration touches only transaction-owned surfaces and compensates failure.
- Actual operator host state is read-only during this slice.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: `71a52dde`
- Revert strategy: revert the entire protocol/profile migration as one unit;
  do not partially restore old names under protocol 2.
