## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass (independent gatekeeper acceptance review PASS; single review at this boundary per review-trigger discipline)
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: `src/core/state/attempt-ledger.ts` (new), `src/effects/state/attempt-ledger-store.ts` (new), `src/core/state/types.ts`, `src/core/state/project-continuation-envelope.ts`, `src/effects/state/resolve-continuation-envelope.ts`, `src/cli/commands/state.ts`, `tests/continuation-attempt.test.ts` (new), WP3 workflow artifacts
- Actual files changed: exactly the intended set plus machinery timestamp in `tasks/todos.md` (start-task scaffold, attribution verified) and the post-review corrections (notes/test-docstring invariant restatement, framing-character class fix)
- Commands passed: `bun test tests/continuation-attempt.test.ts` (20 pass at gate, +adjusted cases post-fix); four-suite regression 71 pass; `bun run check:type` clean; `bun scripts/check-state-boundaries.ts` OK (145 files); `bun test tests/state/` 126 pass; live dogfood on a faithful scratch subject: two no-progress receipts flip the envelope to `halt:no_progress`, a `resumed` receipt clears it, zero writes around `state next` (tree hash identical, no `effective.json`)
- Residual risks: ledger has no GC/rotation and is parsed in full each turn; one corrupt historical line halts the loop closed with no repair command — operator remedy (truncate `.ai/harness/runs/continuation/attempts.jsonl`) must be documented in WP4; the receipt-invisibility invariant is a two-mechanism disjunction (gitignore + operational-path classifier) with no binding test yet — carried to WP4
- Reviewer action required: none — MEDIUM notes-claim falsification fixed in-worktree; the LOW framing-class finding turned out to be a misread of a raw NUL byte in the character class (semantics were already correct: reject `\r\n\0`, allow SPACE) — the raw byte was replaced with proper escapes and space-legality locked by a characterization test; LOW property-vs-lock-isolation test note recorded as-is
- Rollback: revert branch `codex/wp3-no-progress-circuit-breaker` (base `c4cce83a`); no primary-tree state touched before finish

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: sprint contract execution (worktree-first), deep-worker implementation + independent gatekeeper acceptance
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: attempt-ledger honesty constraints adjudicated in `docs/researches/20260803-loopx-comparative-analysis.md` round-2 addendum; sprint WP3 spec; two parent-level decisions fixed pre-dispatch (single flock-appended ledger, fail-closed `attempt_ledger_unreadable`); Falsifier gate ran first — real material progress moved the token, rendering-only writes did not
- Root cause or plan evidence: plan `## Task Breakdown` six slices all delivered; gate falsified the worker's ignored-status necessity claim by direct experiment and identified the true disjunction invariant (`isOperationalReviewPath`, `diff-fingerprint.ts:378`), corrected post-review

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: satisfied by the independent gatekeeper acceptance review (read-only, fresh context, re-ran every gate itself; dogfooded the breaker on real repo bytes reproducing the worktree's exact `progress_token`; verified WP2 containment byte-level; audited fence-test mechanisms not just names); one review per boundary
- Commands run: see Human Review Card; all executed inside the worktree or a scratch clone with the source CLI
- Manual checks: lock substitution adjudicated equivalent (house `withExclusiveDirectoryLock` + `O_APPEND` + fsync; no flock(2) binding exists, no new deps allowed); implied-spec additions (`halted` breaks the consecutive run; unreadable gated on actionable routes) verified as pre-authorized by contract wording and plan item 4; EXECUTION_BOUNDARY clean (exact contracted flags, three outcomes, no GC, no counter file, no MCP/policy changes)
- Supporting artifacts: `tasks/notes/20260803-2040-wp3-no-progress-circuit-breaker.notes.md` (decision table + corrected invariant statement)
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes — gate cross-checked every notes claim against source and falsified one (corrected before finish)
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/runs/` (verify-sprint prepare-acceptance)

- Summary: Independent gatekeeper acceptance PASS: all gates re-run in fresh context (21 attempt tests, 71 four-suite regressions, check:type, state-boundaries 145 files, tests/state 126 pass); breaker dogfooded on faithful real-repo bytes (two no-progress receipts -> halt:no_progress, resumed clears, zero writes); lock substitution adjudicated equivalent; WP2 containment byte-preserved; gate falsified the notes' ignored-status necessity claim and the true disjunction invariant (gitignore + isOperationalReviewPath) was corrected in notes/docstrings before finish; raw-NUL regex byte cleaned to escapes with space-legality characterization test. Residual carried to WP4: ledger repair remedy documentation + disjunction binding test.
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- New surfaces: `repo-harness state attempt` (dumb flock-appended recorder, three outcomes) and stall evaluation inside `state next` — route flips to `halt:no_progress` after >=2 trailing consecutive no-progress completed receipts on the current unit; `halt:attempt_ledger_unreadable` on a corrupt ledger line; both applied only when the WP2 route would otherwise be actionable.
- WP2 envelope behavior byte-preserved (route table untouched, key order identical, all WP2-era tests pass with zero diff); absent ledger === WP2 behavior.
- Zero-write and determinism contracts extended, not weakened: identical repo bytes + identical ledger bytes -> byte-identical envelope; `recorded_at` never appears in envelope output.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 9/10 | 21 tests: stall/reset/isolation/corrupt-line/determinism/fence all fixture-proven; -1 for no repair command on unreadable ledger (deferred to WP4 docs) |
| Product depth | 9/10 | breaker gated on actionable routes; resumed/halted semantics honor consecutive-completed rule; fail-closed on corruption |
| Design quality | 9/10 | ledger is liveness evidence only — fence tests prove it cannot reach state_revision/progress_token; no counter file, recomputed per read |
| Code quality | 9/10 | pure logic / IO split mirrors WP2; house lock primitive reused; raw-NUL source byte cleaned to escapes |

## Failing Items

- (none)

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test tests/continuation-attempt.test.ts tests/continuation-envelope.test.ts tests/sprint-backlog-grammar-drift.test.ts tests/effective-state.test.ts tests/check-state-boundaries.test.ts && bun run check:type`
- Re-check: `bun scripts/check-state-boundaries.ts`; dogfood two no-progress receipts -> `halt:no_progress`, then `--outcome resumed` -> cleared

## Summary

- WP3 delivers the no-progress circuit breaker: `AttemptReceiptV1` recorder appending to the ignored flock'd `attempts.jsonl` ledger, stall evaluation flipping the envelope to `halt:no_progress` after two consecutive no-progress turns on the current unit, reset on token change or explicit resume, fail-closed `attempt_ledger_unreadable` on corruption, and test-enforced authority fences keeping receipts out of Effective State forever. Gatekeeper verdict PASS with the notes' mechanism claim falsified-and-corrected (true invariant: gitignore + operational-path classifier disjunction) before finish.
