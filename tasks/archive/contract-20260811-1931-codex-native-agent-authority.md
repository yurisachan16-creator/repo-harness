## Why

repo-harness currently projects fleet personas into Codex TOML but still tells Codex
to prefer App threads and degrade through native spawn, `codex-exec`, and the main
thread. Codex 0.147 now exposes native `agent_type`; retaining the old ladder leaves
thread metadata, prompt persona, and native runtime identity as competing authorities.
Runtime role/model evidence is also lost when no advisor state was created before
`SubagentStart`, so a valid native selection cannot currently prove readiness.

## Goal

Make native `agent_type` the only Codex fleet identity/lifecycle authority, make
official `SubagentStart` fields sufficient to persist role/model evidence, and
remove automatic semantic authorization plus thread/fallback runner authority from
the runtime, installer, policy projections, tests, and reference documentation.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Native `agent_type` guidance that fails closed when the named role is unavailable.
  - Event-scoped role/model evidence initialized directly from official `SubagentStart` fields.
  - Removal of Codex `delegation.mode=auto`, natural-language trigger inference, App-thread preference, and runner fallbacks.
  - Synchronized policy seeds/mirrors, focused tests, architecture/reference docs, changelog, and task artifacts.
- Out of scope:
  - Claude Task/Agent transport, fleet persona content/model mapping, Codex plugin packaging, MCP goal transport, contract-run execution semantics outside delegation policy projection.
- Taste constraints: one runtime authority; no compatibility aliases, alternate runners, semantic inference, or claim that reasoning effort was observed.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

Stop before the policy cutover if the live Codex 0.147 spawn schema lacks
`agent_type`; `SubagentStart` reports `agent_type=default` or a configured-model
mismatch; either explorer or fast-worker misses its installed output protocol; or
the hook cannot persist role/model evidence without advisor pre-seeding. Missing
reasoning-effort readback is not a falsifier and must remain
`configured_unverified`. The cheapest proof is one read-only explorer canary and
one disposable-write fast-worker canary with official hook evidence.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260811-1344-codex-native-agent-authority.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260811-1344-codex-native-agent-authority.review.md`

- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: run `verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance`, record one typed AcceptanceReceipt under the frozen policy below, then run `verify-sprint`; review Markdown is projection only.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: Codex native agent_type is the only fleet runner authority; Claude remains unchanged.
- Edge cases: missing/default/malformed agent_type or model evidence fails closed; reasoning effort remains configured_unverified.
- Regression risks: user-level install no longer writes delegation.mode; generated policy projections must remain byte/semantic mirrors.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: pre-change branch base
- Revert strategy: revert this work-package branch to restore the thread-first delegation contract.
