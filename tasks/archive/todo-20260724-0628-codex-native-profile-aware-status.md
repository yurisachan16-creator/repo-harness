# Deferred Goal Ledger

> **Status**: Backlog
> **Updated**: (archive-workflow)
> **Scope**: Medium/long-term goals deferred from active plan execution

Current plan tasks live in the active plan's `## Task Breakdown`.
Do not duplicate that execution checklist here. Record only work intentionally deferred beyond this slice, with the tradeoff and revisit trigger.

## Deferred Goals

| Goal | Why Deferred | Tradeoff | Revisit Trigger |
|------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| ESA-06 guarded workflow-artifact writer and optimistic overwrite preconditions | The approved single-engineer Effective State convergence scope is ESA-01..05 plus ESA-07; ESA-06 is an independent mutation/compatibility boundary and was explicitly deferred intact | MCP workflow-artifact writes retain their current semantics; this slice claims no atomic-writer or stale-overwrite protection and adds no compatibility shim | Open the next mutation-kernel work-package only after the owner explicitly approves mandatory revision preconditions and names the next breaking release boundary |
| Interactive `codex` `/agent` check confirming the six `.codex/agents/*.toml` load on cli 0.144.5 | The current CLI still exposes no non-interactive agent-registry introspection surface (`codex --help` and `codex features list`, checked 2026-07-23); C2 smoke remains inconclusive, not failing | Fleet TOMLs are schema-valid but end-to-end recognition remains unproven | First interactive Codex session in this repo after a fleet install or update |
| BDD3-VH1 fixed-boundary visual-hierarchy micro-test (conditional) | Conditional, not scheduled — no observed pain to test against yet; see `docs/researches/20260713-bdd3-ea1-direction-adjudication.md` | ImageGen variants vs. a structured text wireframe, measured on downstream implementation-correction rate; opening it without observed pain risks testing a synthetic preference question, the same failure mode that killed EI3 | An actually observed visual-hierarchy rework pain occurs in real work, not a calendar date |
| Lite ceremony phase-3: promotion-time deterministic envelope projection (when the risk floor promotes mid-session, the harness scaffolds plan/contract skeletons by code so the model fills deltas instead of authoring four documents), plus benchmark criteria re-bucketing by resolved profile and fixing the `cross-capability-feature` scenario prompt that literally instructs "create its required workflow artifacts" | Phase B regrade (run f6684c28) proved the mechanism works where lite applies (true-lite bucket: 1.076x duration vs strict, 1.334x tokens vs no-harness, 0 artifacts) but aggregate criteria 1-3 fail on the two scenarios that are prompt-instructed or floor-promoted past lite; a SessionStart-only guidance field cannot bound a mid-session promotion | Lite's aggregate benchmark story stays "documented partial" until the follow-up ships; the 2-4x runtime envelope-authoring cost at promotion time remains unaddressed | Owner adjudicates scope (B3 mechanism + criteria/scenario revision were explicitly deferred to owner during phase-2 execution); open as its own work-package |
| Rendered-surface anti-extras verification: prove in a real implementation (not an eval) that a design brief's backstage-only concepts and its `UX-{{SLUG}}-N1` scenario actually stop an unauthorized developer-view concept from shipping | No leak has been observed yet; the sealed BDD² Phase E / BDD3-EA1 / BDD3-PS1 kill rounds (`docs/researches/20260714-bdd3-ea1-typed-evidence-authority-outcome.md`, `docs/researches/20260714-bdd3-ps1-protected-shape-outcome.md`) rule out enforcement machinery (validator/ledger/classifier) for this kind of check, so opening it without an observed failure would test a synthetic case — the same failure mode those rounds already killed | The role-aware concept-boundary fields (design brief, design-options, design-proposal) ship now on prose discipline alone, unverified against a real rendered surface, until a concrete leak is observed | First observed case in real work where a confirmed design brief with backstage-only concepts and an N1 scenario still ships an unauthorized developer-view concept; required evidence: task/brief/scenario IDs, DOM or screenshot proof, the exact leaked concept, and why the hand-written scenario test missed it; the response starts with a bounded review and a feature-specific assertion in the affected repo — no global vocabulary, classifier, lifecycle, or new eval suite |
