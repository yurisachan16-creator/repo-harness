## Why

PR #67 introduces a policy-controlled deployment SQL gate used by downstream strict workflow checks. The submitted branch is stale and its new fail-closed claims are falsified by control-character injection, missing invariant files, duplicate basenames across roots, and symlinked SQL files. Shipping it unchanged would let invalid migration assets receive a green workflow result while installed hooks and skills continue to instruct agents to use a contradictory layout.

## Goal

Rebuild PR #67 on current `main` as one coherent work-package that makes `operations.deploy_sql` the single optional override authority, closes every reproduced hollow-green path, preserves the existing `--root deploy/sql` assertion contract, synchronizes the installed guidance surfaces, and reaches green local plus remote PR verification without carrying commit `3bf58a8` or unrelated workflow history.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Apply only the intended configurable deploy-SQL feature on top of current `main`.
  - Reject policy record injection, explicit missing invariant files, duplicate-basename invariant false positives, and regular or escaping SQL symlinks.
  - Preserve `--root deploy/sql` as a non-authoritative assertion and reject other CLI root values.
  - Align source/package helper mirrors, policy seed wording, hooks, deploy skill, generated root guidance, deploy README content, architecture truth, and their existing tests.
  - Maintain the plan, contract, notes, review, workstream/architecture artifacts, and current-status projection required for verified workflow closeout.
- Out of scope:
  - SQL execution, migrations, compatibility fallbacks, new dependencies, unrelated workflow cleanup, and changes to other active worktrees.
- Taste constraints: use direct validation and existing helpers; add no dependency, compatibility alias, parser framework, migration layer, or broad refactor.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

The direction is wrong if the intended three-file feature patch cannot apply to current `main`, or if a regression fixture still gets exit 0 for a forged policy record, explicit missing invariant path, duplicate basename reference, or SQL symlink. The cheapest proof is the focused deploy-SQL helper test group before any distribution-surface edits.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260713-1413-pr67-deploy-sql-policy-fix.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260713-1413-pr67-deploy-sql-policy-fix.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20260713-1413-pr67-deploy-sql-policy-fix.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: `repo-harness run verify-sprint` must see this contract pass, the review recommend pass, and `## External Acceptance Advice` pass or record a manual override.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: default deploy/sql ordered4 semantics remain intact; explicit policy roots become the only alternate authority.
- Edge cases: control characters, missing explicit invariant, duplicate basenames, symlinked SQL, overlapping roots, traversal, unknown naming, and CLI --root behavior are covered.
- Regression risks: shell/Bun record parsing, packaged helper resolution, hook guidance parity, scaffold policy wording, and strict workflow integration.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: rebased `origin/main` at `f248e76f81a00d6b9a306cb4c69119c3ea9c5805` and pre-remediation remote PR head `0bfbb657367b253b29ba430065bc2027de9c5a95`.
- Revert strategy: revert the single rebuilt PR commit, or restore the recorded remote PR head with `--force-with-lease` before merge.
