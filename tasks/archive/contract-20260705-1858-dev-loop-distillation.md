## Why

Delegated executor models currently receive only task text plus allowed paths from the brief; they never see purpose, are never required to self-verify before reporting, and are never told when to stop and escalate. Distilling these instructions into the file-coupled brief surface (template + generated prompts + preflight) is what lets weaker models inherit the dev loop's quality guarantees. The engine-integrity fixes ensure the packaged runtime that `repo-harness run` executes matches what we develop and test. If this ships wrong, every downstream generated repo inherits a brief surface that under-informs its executors.

## Goal

Execute the dev-loop distillation Phase 3 plan: reconcile helper mirrors, auto-refresh the resume packet, add Why/Stop-Conditions/Exemplar to the contract brief surface, upgrade contract-run worker/verifier prompts with mandatory self-verification and stop/escalation contracts, gate ## Why in preflight, ship a golden example brief, add the finish-time memory advisory, record runner usage in the contract-run manifest, teach the four repo-harness skills, and pass the full verification battery.

## Scope

- In scope: slices 0, A1-A3, B1-B4, C1, D1(reduced), G1, F1 exactly as specified in the captured plan.
- Out of scope: touching assets/hooks/codex-delegation-advisor.sh or .ai/hooks/codex-delegation-advisor.sh (delivered by ca76def on the base branch); cross-runner auto-degradation inside contract-run; maintenance-triage --write; porting native-subagent hooks; superpowers imports; weakening existing gates; any git push or PR creation.
- slice B5 (projection-time [Brief]/[BriefPreflight] advisory in plan-to-todo) — delegated to parallel branch codex/projection-brief-advisory; revisit trigger recorded in the plan Task Breakdown

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260705-1419-dev-loop-distillation.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260705-1419-dev-loop-distillation.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20260705-1419-dev-loop-distillation.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: `scripts/verify-sprint.sh` must see this contract pass, the review recommend pass, and `## External Acceptance Advice` pass or record a manual override.

```

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior:
- Edge cases:
- Regression risks:

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: ca76def (stack base)
- Revert strategy: drop branch codex/dev-loop-distillation + its worktree; stack base codex/advisor-file-coupled-nudge and main unaffected
