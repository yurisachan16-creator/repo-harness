## Why

BDD² Audit is still an unverified product hypothesis. Without a frozen comparison
against the existing review rubric, the project cannot know whether behavior audit
finds more real journey/exposure/recovery defects or merely produces more plausible
findings. Shipping product surfaces before this proof would recreate the
overengineering problem the module is intended to prevent.

## Goal

Deliver an independently reviewable Experiment A result from 12 held-out fixtures,
two review conditions, and two repetitions: 48 successful outputs, 48 locked
condition-blind Agent-panel scores, a deterministic durable evidence projection,
and a Pass or Kill report covering precision, overall/P0-P1 recall, clean false
positives, correct no-findings, severity agreement, and correction cost.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Directly cut evaluation authority to v3 with per-experiment score/metric files.
  - Rename the global Shape schema to a Shape-only path without an alias.
  - Complete six seeded and six clean held-out Audit fixtures plus exhaustive truth.
  - Implement fail-closed Audit score, coordinate, evidence, and summary validation.
  - Seal and run A with the exact Codex 0.144.1 / gpt-5.6-sol / xhigh profile.
  - Record Agent-panel proxy limitations, Pass/Kill gates, and one E-03 PR.
  - Synchronize Sprint/plan/current workflow evidence for E-02 and E-03.
- Out of scope:
  - Rerunning or changing Experiment S.
  - Browser/ImageGen Experiment E, implementation pilot I, or final Phase E decision.
  - Public BDD skill, CLI/MCP tool, hook, `/check` integration, catalog, sidecar,
    validator, lifecycle, or product runtime.
  - New dependencies, generic eval framework/service/database, compatibility reader,
    or human-panel claim.
- Taste constraints: one authority per datum; exact schemas; fail closed on leakage,
  ambiguity, coordinate drift, duplicate truth matches, and missing evidence.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop before execution if any prompt, task, truth, rubric, schema, metric, runner,
  model, version, sampling, or environment value is not frozen and hashed.
- Stop and invalidate the revision if held-out truth/treatment identity reaches an
  agent/reviewer packet, or if source-commit evidence cannot be reconstructed.
- Stop if completing A requires an Experiment E/I or Phase P product surface.
- Record `Kill` without threshold changes if any pre-registered Audit gate fails.
- Stop and hand back if a required change falls outside Allowed Paths.

## Falsifier

The direction is falsified when treatment precision is below 70%, overall seeded
recall below 80%, P0/P1 recall below 100%, clean false-positive rate above 20%,
correct no-findings below 80%, severity agreement below 85%, or any P0/P1 issue is
underestimated. The cheapest proof is the deterministic summary over validated
locked scores; no product code is needed.

## Root Cause Evidence

Not applicable; this is an evaluation work package, not a bugfix.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: exact 48-coordinate run, 48 locked scores, generated evidence,
  every Audit metric/gate, and explicit Pass or Kill.
- Edge cases: clean pass/inconclusive distinction, duplicate truth match, unmatched
  finding, missing coordinate/score, prompt drift, P0/P1 underestimation, zero
  findings denominator, authority gap, and Agent failure.
- Regression risks: breaking historical Shape projection, coupling S/A freeze, or
  presenting Agent-panel proxy evidence as human judgment.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: sealed A authority commit before model execution, followed by
  locked-score and report commits.
- Revert strategy: revert the E-03 PR and remove ignored A-v1 run evidence; no
  product runtime, data migration, or compatibility state exists.
