## Design Decisions

- Keep the Stop-time git cursor as the only changed-set authority. The defect is acknowledgement conflation, not changed-set construction.
- Treat runner absence and any non-zero command in a request-triggered legacy cascade as delivery failure. Cursor acknowledgement represents completion of the complete legacy cascade, not merely the primary classifier call.

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

- The first frozen full-suite run exposed one task-related stale characterization: the LSC Stop fixtures still expected a cursor write when no legacy cascade runner completed delivery. The three golden side-effect lists now omit that write, matching the fail-closed acknowledgement contract. No production scope was widened.

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Restore journal architecture delivery | Reject | Reintroduces dual authority and still misses shell writes. |
| Advance after `architecture-queue record` but ignore follow-up failures | Reject | The frozen plan names the cascade outcome as the acknowledgement boundary; partial context/capability sync is not complete delivery. |
| Return a typed result from the existing cascade function | Use | Smallest change that lets both consumers fail closed without duplicating classifier semantics. |

## Open Questions

- None.

## Evidence Links

- Checks: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Pre-fix regression: `.ai/harness/runs/legacy-cascade-ack-pre-fix.log` records the two focused guards failing against the original implementation (43 pass, 2 fail).
- Targeted green: `bun test tests/architecture-drift.test.ts tests/stop-handler.test.ts tests/mutation-observed.test.ts tests/architecture-projection-orchestration.test.ts` (78 pass, 0 fail).
- Typecheck: `bun run check:type` (exit 0).
- First full-suite run: 2363 pass, 1 skip, 1 fail. The sole failure was `tests/state/loop-semantics-characterization.test.ts`, which identified the stale cursor-write golden updated in this slice; log: `.ai/harness/runs/run-20260812T151122-73651-bun-test.log`.

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.

## Promotion Candidates

- Promote to `tasks/lessons.md` only after a repeated correction or failure pattern.
- Promote to `docs/researches/` only when it is durable repo knowledge with evidence.
- Promote to harness asset files only after verification across more than one task or fixture.
