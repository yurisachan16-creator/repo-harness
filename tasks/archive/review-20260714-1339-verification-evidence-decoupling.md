## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass; the four approved slices decouple evidence production from the verification gate exactly as contracted, with two external-review P2 hardening fixes folded in
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: diff-fingerprint hash payload, verify-sprint external-acceptance gate (+ assets mirror), reference-doc invariant, benchmark arm cleanup, reversed freshness/workflow-state tests, workflow artifacts
- Actual files changed: matches intended; all changed files inside contract `allowed_paths` (gatekeeper-verified per path)
- Commands passed: targeted suites (review-freshness, workflow-state-lib, harness-benchmark-matrix), typecheck, full `bun test` 1392 pass/0 fail, SQL order, architecture sync, task sync, strict workflow, project inspection, adopt dry-run
- External acceptance: pass from Codex (`codex-review`), round 2 after fail->fix->re-gate; final mechanical binding to the closeout fingerprint
- Residual risks: unrelated target advance intentionally no longer stales acceptance — post-rebase integration risk is owned by the deterministic verifier at ship time (approved design); README wording still describes the retired `not_required` Card projection (doc-only follow-up, outside contract paths)
- Reviewer action required: none
- Rollback: revert the slice commits on `codex/verification-evidence-decoupling`; fingerprint semantic change and its test reversal share one commit

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: plan-to-todo contract worktree execution with dual-gate acceptance (Claude gatekeeper review + Codex external acceptance)
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: dual-track audit (GPT research `docs/researches/20260714-gpt-review.md` + Opus independent audit) adjudicated in the approved plan; gatekeeper PASS verified all slices against the diff and ran the full required-check suite; Codex round-1 REJECT produced one adjudicated-by-design P1 and two fixed P2s (`ddeddfdf`, `7f16ec01`), round-2 ACCEPT confirmed the fixes and retained only advisories
- Root cause or plan evidence: `plans/plan-20260714-0430-verification-evidence-decoupling.md` (P1/P2/P3 sections; 明确删除/明确不做 lists)

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: gatekeeper read-only acceptance pass (diff-verified per slice, prohibitions checked, full required-check suite executed)
- Commands run: `bun test tests/review-freshness.test.ts tests/workflow-state-lib.test.ts tests/harness-benchmark-matrix.test.ts`; `bun run check:type`; `bun src/cli/index.ts run check-task-workflow --strict`; `bash scripts/check-deploy-sql-order.sh`; `bash scripts/check-architecture-sync.sh`; `bash scripts/check-task-sync.sh`; `bun scripts/inspect-project-state.ts --repo . --format text`; `bun src/cli/index.ts adopt --repo . --dry-run`; full `bun test` (1392 pass, 1 pre-existing skip, 0 fail)
- Manual checks: no verifier surface (contract, templates, reference docs) contains a live benchmark matrix command; assets/repo verify-sprint copies byte-identical
- Supporting artifacts: `docs/researches/20260714-gpt-review.md` (external dual-track evidence)
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes — all non-obvious decisions recorded (both hash sites, falsifier sweeps, host-only cleanup rationale, external-review dispositions)
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/runs/` per verify-sprint execution

## External Acceptance Advice

> **External Acceptance**: pass
> **External Reviewer**: Codex
> **External Source**: codex-review
> **Reviewed Diff Fingerprint**: sha256:9ee69527000fdbf14a7e0b75bdb759240f5fb92e200a33734db7b93cb4e4196e

- P1 blockers: none
- P2 advisories: multilingual README wording still says `not_required` permits acceptance (runtime is correct; doc clarification is a follow-up outside this contract's allowed paths); integration-context concern retained as advisory — unrelated target advance intentionally does not stale acceptance and correctness depends on the deterministic verifier running at current HEAD before ship, as the approved plan assigns; benchmark cleanup-order assertion is a source-text test whose limitation is recorded in notes
- Acceptance checklist: round 1 (codex session 019f5ed8-84a9-79c1-8887-557962437ff9) REJECT with 1 P1 + 3 P2 — P1 adjudicated by-design against the approved plan's rejection list, two P2s fixed (`ddeddfdf` gate literal removal, `7f16ec01` real canonical-failure tests), one P2 accepted advisory (`53fd80bc` notes); round 2 (codex session 019f5ef9-3d96-78a3-b57f-c1de6207337b) VERDICT: ACCEPT with no P1; final mechanical binding confirmed VERDICT: ACCEPT for the exact closeout fingerprint above after the authorized contract status flip

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Acceptance freshness no longer churns on unrelated target advance or clean rebase (base_ref/base_rev now metadata-only); same-file target changes still stale through the three-dot patch hash
- verify-sprint external acceptance accepts only canonical `pass|manual_override`; Card is a display projection and the dead `not_required` literal is removed from both copies
- Benchmark arms delete their disposable host toolchain root after result extraction; base/workspace retained for `--regrade-existing`

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- README `not_required` wording clarification (doc-only, outside contract paths)
- Deferred (tasks/todos.md): benchmark per-profile install refactor; contract commands_succeed structural ban check only after a concrete recurrence
