## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass (independent gatekeeper acceptance review, PASS with 4/4 verification gates re-run in fresh context; single review at this boundary per review-trigger discipline)
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: `scripts/contract-worktree.sh`, `scripts/ship-worktrees.sh` (canonical), their `assets/templates/helpers/` projections, `tests/contract-worktree-closeout-journal.test.ts`, WP1 workflow artifacts
- Actual files changed: exactly the intended set, plus machinery timestamp in `tasks/todos.md` (start-task, 18:24, attribution verified) and a closeout-added GC deferred-goal row
- Commands passed: `bun test tests/contract-worktree-closeout-journal.test.ts` (11 pass, 259 asserts at gate; +2 ship-phase cases added post-review); `bun test tests/contract-worktree-squash-cleanup.test.ts tests/helper-scripts.test.ts tests/sprint-backlog.test.ts` (150 pass, 1554 asserts); `bun run check:type` clean; `bun scripts/sync-helper-sources.ts --check` projection OK (52 helpers)
- Residual risks: stale `aborted` journal accumulation (deferred to `tasks/todos.md` with revisit trigger); directory not fsynced after atomic rename (spec-literal implementation; residual exposure limited to disk-full or crash inside a non-journaling filesystem window)
- Reviewer action required: none — findings adjudicated by orchestrator; the MEDIUM ship-phase coverage gap was fixed in-worktree before finish
- Rollback: revert branch `codex/wp1-crash-durable-closeout-transaction` (base `5d6a9e41`); no primary-tree state touched before finish

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: sprint contract execution (worktree-first), deep-worker implementation + independent gatekeeper acceptance
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: `docs/researches/20260803-loopx-comparative-analysis.md` §7.1 + round-2 addendum (dual-track adjudicated design); sprint WP1 spec in `plans/sprints/20260803-1810-long-run-anti-drift.sprint.md`
- Root cause or plan evidence: recovery blind spot demonstrated by fault injection (fresh-process discovery of snapshot/original HEAD impossible pre-change); plan `## Task Breakdown` six slices all delivered

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: satisfied by the independent gatekeeper acceptance review (read-only, fresh context, re-ran every gate itself); one review per boundary
- Commands run: see Human Review Card; all executed inside the worktree with the source CLI
- Manual checks: scope-widening adjudication (canonical `scripts/` vs enforced projection — necessary, minimal, recorded); four spec deviations adjudicated as worker-level fail-closed refinements, none triggered Stop Conditions; EXECUTION_BOUNDARY clean (no surfaces beyond `recover inspect|abort|reconcile` + `--key` selector); journal-metastasis grep zero hits from `src/` or collectors
- Supporting artifacts: `tasks/notes/20260803-1824-wp1-crash-durable-closeout-transaction.notes.md` (deviation entries + duplicate-not-extract rationale)
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes — all deviation entries cross-checked against the sprint WP1 spec and contract Stop Conditions
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/runs/` (verify-sprint prepare-acceptance)

- Summary: Independent gatekeeper acceptance PASS: 4/4 verification gates re-run in fresh context (13 fault-injection tests incl. both push-PR windows, 150 helper regressions, check:type, projection byte-identity); scope widening to canonical scripts/ adjudicated necessary+minimal; four deviations adjudicated fail-closed worker-level refinements; EXECUTION_BOUNDARY clean; journal provably unread by state resolvers. Post-review allowed-paths updates sanction machinery ledger/back-fill writes (todos.md, plans/). Residual: journal GC deferred to todos.md with trigger; directory-fsync gap noted (disk-full window only).
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Uninterrupted finish/ship: observable behavior unchanged apart from journal writes (happy-path test asserts prior stdout + archive effects byte-for-byte; 150 pre-existing helper tests green).
- Interrupted finish/ship: previously unrecoverable-by-tooling; now every phase leaves a discoverable journal + snapshot + original HEAD, plain rerun fails closed naming `recover`, `abort` restores pre-closeout state before irreversible phases, `reconcile` completes external-effect windows without duplicate push/merge.
- Effective State resolution: byte-identical with and without an `in_progress` journal (no-read guard test).

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Stale `aborted`/different-key journal accumulation → `tasks/todos.md` deferred row (revisit trigger: observable growth or next journal-primitive work-package).
- Directory fsync after atomic rename not performed (spec-literal); exposure limited to disk-full / crash inside a non-journaling filesystem window.
- This contract's own finish is the first live exercise of the journal it adds.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 9/10 | 13 fault-injection/journal tests incl. both push→PR windows; -1 for deferred journal GC |
| Product depth | 9/10 | recover verbs cover inspect/abort/reconcile with verified-effect gating; no auto-resume by design |
| Design quality | 9/10 | fail-closed refinements beyond literal spec (verified-effect gate, HEAD-bound replay); journal provably outside state authority |
| Code quality | 8/10 | matches helper house style; deliberate 219-line duplicate between the two scripts (byte-identical, rationale in notes) instead of a shared file that would widen scope |

## Failing Items

- (none)

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test tests/contract-worktree-closeout-journal.test.ts && bun test tests/contract-worktree-squash-cleanup.test.ts tests/helper-scripts.test.ts tests/sprint-backlog.test.ts && bun run check:type`
- Re-check: `bun scripts/sync-helper-sources.ts --check`

## Summary

- WP1 delivers `CloseoutJournalV1` for contract-worktree finish and ship-worktrees: git-common-dir journal with deterministic key, per-phase fsync'd records, fail-closed re-entry, explicit `recover inspect|abort|reconcile`, per-phase SIGKILL fault-injection proof, and a test-enforced guarantee that state resolution never reads the journal. Gatekeeper verdict PASS; MEDIUM ship-phase coverage finding fixed in-worktree; GC deferred with trigger.
