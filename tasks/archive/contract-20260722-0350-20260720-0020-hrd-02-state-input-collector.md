## Why

HRD-03..06 replace per-event shell scripts with in-process handlers, and each
handler needs repo facts and the Effective State without re-reading or
re-resolving what the event already knows. Without one collector established
first, each cutover would invent its own fact-gathering, reproducing today's
duplicate-read problem inside TypeScript instead of shell. If this package
ships wrong — eager collection, double resolution, or nondeterministic
snapshots — every later handler inherits either the old fan-out cost or a
flaky input surface.

## Goal

Deliver a lazy, memoizing, once-per-event `StateInputCollector` constructed at
the `runHook()` entry and handed to downstream code, such that each repo fact
and the Effective State resolution are collected at most once per event and
only when first requested. Host-visible behavior is unchanged: the HRD-01
characterization golden passes byte-identically, and SessionStart/Stop keep
exactly one Effective State resolution each.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - New module `src/effects/loop/state-input-collector.ts`: a factory that
    builds one collector per hook event. Interface covers the audit §5.1
    Sense inputs (`plans/sprints/20260715-harness-loop-audit-and-optimization.md:1153-1170`):
    repo identity/root, policy, active work package and contract markers,
    worktree ownership, candidate/diff summary, capability mapping, latest
    evidence heads, and the Effective State resolution. Every getter is lazy
    and memoized (at most one underlying collection per fact per event); no
    collection happens at construction. Each getter delegates to the existing
    authority (e.g. the current resolve path under `src/effects/state/`) —
    no new parsers, no second representation of any authority.
  - Wire `runHook()` (`src/cli/hook/runtime.ts`) to construct exactly one
    collector per event and thread it to the internal call sites that will
    consume it in HRD-03..06. For SessionStart, route the existing single
    Effective State resolution (`effectiveStateSessionSection`) through the
    collector so the memoized path is exercised in production with identical
    output and identical subprocess count. No other call site changes
    behavior; scripts are untouched.
  - New test `tests/state-input-collector.test.ts` (fixture
    `tests/fixtures/loop-runtime/state-input-collector.json` if a golden is
    needed): determinism (same fixture repo → same collected snapshot,
    normalizing only path/time/PID), memoization (N gets → 1 underlying
    collection, proven with a counting probe), laziness (constructing a
    collector performs zero collections), and the SessionStart
    single-resolution invariant.
  - Regression gate: `tests/hook-runtime-characterization.test.ts` must pass
    with the HRD-01 golden byte-identical — this is the machine proof that
    the wiring is behavior-inert. Do not regenerate the golden.
  - Pin the HRD-02 execution base in the sprint header of
    `plans/sprints/20260719-1531-hook-runtime-diet.sprint.md` (add the line
    under the HRD-01 pin), following the successor-pin precedent.
- Out of scope:
  - Any handler cutover: PreEdit (HRD-03), SessionStart script consolidation
    (HRD-04), PostEdit journal (HRD-05), Stop handler (HRD-06). No script
    under `.ai/hooks/` / `assets/hooks/` changes; no script is retired.
  - Eager entry-point collection for events whose scripts still self-resolve
    (PreEdit/Stop) — adding a second resolution anywhere fails this contract.
  - Circuit/lock changes (HRD-07), telemetry aggregation (HRD-08),
    retirement (HRD-09); LoopEventResult production or protocol changes
    (`src/core/loop/loop-event-protocol.ts` stays untouched).
  - Semantic changes to `ArtifactRequirementPolicy`, `evaluateReadiness`,
    revisions, progress token, or state-version allocation.
  - Every path outside Allowed Paths; compatibility code, dual authority,
    semantic fallback, or a second fact-parsing path.
- Taste constraints: the collector is a thin memoizing facade over existing
  effects functions — if a getter needs new parsing logic, the getter is
  wrong; move on or hand back. Laziness must be structural (thunks/once
  wrappers), not flag-checked at each call site.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path
  outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if exercising the collector on SessionStart cannot keep output and
  subprocess count byte-identical to the HRD-01 golden.
- Stop if any fact cannot be served by delegating to an existing authority
  without new parsing.
- Stop if the HRD-01 characterization golden would need regeneration or any
  existing test changes value.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop after three fail -> fix -> reverify rounds for the same issue.

## Falsifier

The one-collector-per-event direction is falsified if lazy memoized
collection cannot keep SessionStart byte-identical (meaning the existing
resolution path has hidden per-call side effects the collector cannot
preserve). Cheapest proof point: route `effectiveStateSessionSection` through
the collector first and run the characterization test before building any
other getter; if the golden shifts, stop.

- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this
  contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: `repo-harness run verify-sprint` must see this contract
  pass, the review recommend pass, and canonical `## External Acceptance
  Advice` record `pass` for the current review subject and benchmark evidence.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: collector exists and is threaded from the entry, but
  the only production path exercising it is SessionStart's existing single
  resolution; all host-visible outputs identical to the HRD-01 baseline.
- Edge cases: events with no repo (opt-out), corrupt cache, and concurrent
  events must not break laziness or memoization; collector must not leak
  state across events.
- Regression risks: hidden side effects in the existing resolution path
  (cache writes, version allocation) must flow through unchanged — the
  characterization golden and the state tests are the guards.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: branch fork point `b57d6323fb8ba6a0edb55117abaf9953913d9ddf`
- Revert strategy: revert the independent HRD-02 PR; the package adds one effects module and tests plus a thin entry wiring in `runtime.ts` — reverting restores the exact HRD-01 baseline.
