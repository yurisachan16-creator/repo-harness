## Why

The approved Phase E protocol must end in explicit decisions. Without E-06, gated
adapter/pilot rows remain ambiguous and a future agent could treat missing runs as
permission to productize Browser, ImageGen, audit, or workflow surfaces.

## Goal

Create one authoritative Phase E decision report, synchronize Sprint outcomes, and
prove that no failed or untested hypothesis authorizes Phase P.

## Scope

- In scope: final decision report, Sprint E-03/E-04/E-05/E-06 projection, plan,
  contract, review, notes, and current-status projection.
- Out of scope: evaluation reruns, new fixtures/runner code, product implementation,
  adapters, public skills/tools/hooks, schemas, sidecars, and compatibility paths.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop if the merged S/A reports do not reproduce `Reshape` and `Kill`.
- Stop if E/I execution is required; their prerequisites are false.
- Stop if closeout adds product or runtime surface.

## Falsifier

Any Phase P authorization, changed experiment threshold, or claim that a gated-not-run
adapter was empirically rejected invalidates this contract.

```

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Shape is `Reshape`; Audit is `Kill`.
- Browser, ImageGen, and implementation pilot are `Defer` because prerequisites
  failed, not because their experiments produced negative evidence.
- Phase P and every public BDD product surface remain unauthorized.

## Rollback Point

- Revert the E-06 PR. Do not alter the already merged S/A historical evidence.
