# Deferred Goal Ledger

> **Status**: Backlog
> **Updated**: 2026-07-05 20:36
> **Scope**: Medium/long-term goals deferred from active plan execution

Current plan tasks live in the active plan's `## Task Breakdown`.
Do not duplicate that execution checklist here. Record only work intentionally deferred beyond this slice, with the tradeoff and revisit trigger.

## Deferred Goals

| Goal | Why Deferred | Tradeoff | Revisit Trigger |
|------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| Codex re-acceptance of the merged authority-closure diff (fingerprint-bound rubric), superseding the review's manual override | Ship gate used the documented manual-override lane; a fresh cross-vendor pass on the merged tree is the stronger closure (precedent: contract-intent-boundary 2affc9f) | Override lane is honest but weaker than a bound external pass | Next `/codex` review session, or before the next release that ships template/gate surfaces |
| Interactive `codex` `/agent` check confirming the three `.codex/agents/*.toml` load on cli 0.141.0 | No automatable introspection surface on this codex-cli version (C2 smoke inconclusive, not failing) | Fleet TOMLs are schema-valid but end-to-end recognition unproven | First interactive Codex session in this repo |
