## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass (independent read-only gatekeeper review of this implementation, plus a comparative adjudication against a parallel sibling implementation of the same contract; this branch adopted as the stronger mechanism)
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: `scripts/contract-worktree.sh`, `scripts/ship-worktrees.sh` + `assets/templates/helpers/` projections; `docs/reference-configs/long-run-continuation.md`; `docs/spec.md`; `tests/contract-worktree-closeout-journal.test.ts`; `tests/continuation-conformance.test.ts`; `docs/researches/20260803-loopx-comparative-analysis.md`; workflow quartet
- Actual files changed: the intended set (13 files at `6dc64877`) plus post-review finding fixes (conflict-message remediation pointers, halt-reason table placement, spec ledger clause, gateLog assertion, barrier-fired assertion, PID-reuse todos row)
- Commands passed: closeout-journal suite 16 pass/373 asserts; conformance 3 pass/155 asserts twice (deterministic); attempt+envelope+helper-scripts 160 pass; check:type clean; projection OK (52 helpers); task-sync clean; independent falsifier — helpers reverted to 737dcdce in a scratch copy: race tests 4/4 RED with the predicted tmp-file corruption (ship side: both racers lose), fixed helpers GREEN
- Residual risks: claim liveness is PID-only (reused PID pins a claim live; fail-closed, deferred to `tasks/todos.md` with trigger); claim scope is per-worktree+operation, matching the pre-existing journal scoping
- Reviewer action required: none — MEDIUM/LOW findings fixed in-worktree before finish; PID-reuse trade-off recorded in the deferred-goal ledger
- Rollback: revert branch `codex/long-run-conformance-closure` (base `737dcdce`); no primary-tree state touched before finish

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: external (Codex-session) implementation of the WP5 contract, adopted after a dual-track comparative review; orchestrator-owned closeout
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: contract `tasks/contracts/20260803-2235-long-run-conformance-closure.contract.md`; external program review findings 1-3; comparative adjudication recorded in the closeout report
- Root cause or plan evidence: pre-fix red proof captured as `pre_fix_failure_artifact` (`.ai/harness/runs/20260803-2235-long-run-conformance-closure/pre-fix-concurrent-closeout.log`, PRE_FIX_EXIT=1) and independently reproduced by the reviewing gate with the identical corruption signature

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: satisfied by the independent gatekeeper review (fresh context, re-ran every gate, reverted-helper falsification, 3-way merge-exposure probe against main `cee331d1` — clean); one review per boundary
- Commands run: see Human Review Card; all inside this worktree or scratch copies with the source CLI
- Manual checks: claim lifecycle traced end to end (acquire after scan; pid-gated release — loser cannot release winner; EXIT-trap coverage acquire->begin; nested recovery.lock; `abort_orphan` with status.json guard); doc tick order walked step-by-step implementable; driver consumes `state resolve` stdout with cross-checks
- Supporting artifacts: `tasks/notes/20260803-2235-long-run-conformance-closure.notes.md` (primitive choice, rejected alternatives, barrier design)
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes — honest about barrier-broadening sequence after the red proof
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/runs/` (verify-sprint prepare-acceptance)

- Summary: Adopted branch of the dual-track WP5 implementation, re-attested after merging origin/main cee331d1 (todos.md conflict resolved: main round-3 rows kept, PID-reuse deferred row appended). Independent gatekeeper review PASS with reverted-helper falsification (4/4 RED unfixed, GREEN fixed, finish+ship races); claim lifecycle traced; doc implementable; driver consumes state resolve stdout; six post-review findings fixed in-worktree. Codex program findings 1-3 closed; finding 4 (release cutover) separate.
- Findings: none
