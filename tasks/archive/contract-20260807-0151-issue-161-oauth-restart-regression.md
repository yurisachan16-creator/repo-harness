## Why

GitHub issue #161 reported invalid_client / invalid_grant after a local OAuth server restart (in another tool). repo-harness answered that its MCP OAuth state survives restarts, but that claim is only backed by a throwaway runtime probe: `tests/cli/mcp-http.test.ts` covers client reload only, and `tests/cli/mcp-oauth.test.ts` tests are single-store. Without a committed regression test, a future change to `McpOAuthTokenStore.load()`/`flush()` or the refresh exchange could silently reintroduce the exact failure the issue asked about.

## Goal

`tests/cli/mcp-oauth.test.ts` contains one new test case, `dynamic client and refresh token survive server restart (issue #161)`, that fails if cross-restart DCR client lookup or refresh-token exchange breaks, and the full test suite stays green.

## Scope

- In scope: add exactly one test case inside the existing `mcp oauth provider` describe block in `tests/cli/mcp-oauth.test.ts`, matching existing style (mkdtempSync + try/finally rmSync, reuse `redirectRecorder()`). Scenario: store A registers a dynamic client and completes authorize + `exchangeAuthorizationCode` with `repo-harness offline_access` scopes; a fresh store B on the same path calls `load()`; assert `getClient` finds the client, `exchangeRefreshToken` with the old refresh token succeeds with rotated tokens, `verifyAccessToken` passes on the new access token, and reusing the old refresh token rejects with `InvalidGrantError`.
- Out of scope: production code changes, other test files, refactors of existing tests.
- Taste constraints: <!-- advisory only, no run gate; default style/taste lives in AGENTS.md and the minimal-change policy, use this to record a per-task override -->

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

If the new test passes even when `McpOAuthTokenStore.load()` is skipped on store B (i.e. it does not actually exercise the restart path), the test is worthless. Cheapest proof point: temporarily comment out `storeB.load()` locally and confirm the test fails.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

- Regression risks:

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: dbf0a397 (worktree base)
- Revert strategy: revert the single test addition in `tests/cli/mcp-oauth.test.ts`; no production code is touched.
