## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass
- Change type: migration
- Intended files changed: install profile/state authority, host/skill
  projections, status/setup diagnostics, benchmark projection, tests, and
  current operator/architecture documentation.
- Actual files changed: 39 implementation/test/doc paths plus this plan,
  contract, notes, review, and generated current-status projection.
- Commands passed: focused 118-test final regression; typecheck; strict
  workflow and root checks; 28/28 strict contract verification; disposable
  HOME characterization; retired-name scan 5/5 after its timeout budget fix.
- Residual risks: No operator HOME was migrated, so actual host cutover
  remains an explicit operator action.
- Reviewer action required: none. The anticipated target overlap was resolved
  by preserving both main's provenance allowlist additions and this slice's
  timeout budget; the combined test passes 5/5.
- Rollback: revert protocol 2, migration command, both profile projections,
  tests, and docs together.

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: work-package migration with Sol Max read-only ship gate.
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: the plan maps profile/state/catalog/adapter consumers,
  traces fresh and legacy installs end to end, and records the protocol-2
  decision plus its ownership/rollback invariant.
- Root cause or plan evidence: protocol-1 `minimal` meant five hooks, so
  changing it in place would silently reinterpret persisted authority.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: represented by source strict workflow check, strict
  contract verification, and Sol Max diff review; no external Claude review
  was invoked.
- Commands run: `bun test` (2059 pass, 1 skip, one isolated fixed-timeout
  failure); targeted retired-name scan 5/5 after budget correction; focused
  profile matrix 118/118; `bun run check:type`; required root checks;
  `verify-contract --strict` 28/28.
- Manual checks: exact profile vocabulary `minimal|full`, Codex counts 7/11,
  default full, adapter legacy gate before mutation, valid-legacy versus
  corrupt-state setup actions, and the resolved target-overlap diff.
- Supporting artifacts:
  `.ai/harness/runs/20260724-0427-codex-native-profile-aware-status/profile-migration-red.txt`
  and `profile-migration-characterization.txt`.
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes.
- Run snapshot: contract verification materialized `Fulfilled`.

- Summary: 批准为 codex-native-profile-aware-status 记录 user waiver 并完成合并推送
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Fresh/global and adapter-only installs default to full.
- Minimal deterministically projects seven Codex hooks; full projects eleven.
- Protocol 1 is rejected by normal mutation/state paths and migrates only
  through the explicit transactional action.
- Status/setup distinguish valid legacy state from corrupt state and never
  recommend a guaranteed-failing migration.
- Benchmark runtime selection now maps adaptive-lite to minimal and
  strict-harness to full.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Target overlap was mechanically merged and its combined
  `retired-names-scan.test.ts` result is 5/5.
- Operator HOME remains intentionally unchanged.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 9/10 | Exact 7/11 projections, defaults, diagnostics, and migration compensation are covered. |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Removes the retired tier without preserving ambiguous aliases. |
| Design quality | 9/10 | Protocol boundary and one-shot migration keep a single steady-state authority. |
| Code quality | 9/10 | Focused and contract suites pass; rollback is byte-for-byte tested. |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: branch CI after mainline merge.
- Re-check completed: combined `retired-names-scan.test.ts` contains main's
  two `classify-historical-plans.ts` allowlist entries and this slice's
  10-second scan budget; 5/5 tests pass.

## Summary

- Sol Max final implementation gate: PASS, no blocking source/diff findings.
- Post-gate mainline reconciliation: PASS; only the anticipated mechanical
  overlap changed the reviewed subject, and its combined test passes 5/5.
- Contract: Fulfilled, 28/28.
- Recommendation: pass for Git closeout after preserving the one overlapping
  target-file change.
