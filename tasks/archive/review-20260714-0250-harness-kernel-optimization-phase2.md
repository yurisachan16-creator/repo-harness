## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: plan phases A1/A2 (pre-edit guard batch scope + single-field state resolve), B1/B2 (benchmark artifact_files instrumentation + profile-bound ceremony guidance), C1/C2/C3 (capability-registry hardening, implementation-surface predicate unification, gate-semantics doc), D1 (facade retirement plumbing + gptpro profile wiring; 20→≤5 deletion re-sequenced out per the plan's own clause), E1-E4 (CHANGELOG, phase-1 review verification, dead schema fields, installed-profile readback), plus this workflow package.
- Actual files changed: 31 paths, all inside contract `allowed_paths` (one path legitimized by in-flight contract amendment `0544dfd2`); every changed file traces to a plan phase; no cross-goal entanglement. Base `c604e3b`, HEAD `7655d610`, 12 ordered commits, no push/merge/deploy/secret mutation from this worktree.
- Commands passed: full suite 1325 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail; typecheck clean; check:hooks projection OK (25 files) incl. new surface-predicate drift check; deploy-sql order, architecture-sync (blocking=0), task-sync, inspector, adopt dry-run all exit 0; authoritative live 3x9 matrix 27/27 (run f6684c28, source commit 900854ff, evidence hashes recorded).
- External acceptance: pass — three-round cross-model Codex review (gpt-5.6-sol, read-only codex exec): round 1 found 4 P1 + 4 P2 (all verified, fixed, or adjudicated with recorded tradeoffs), round 2 narrowed to 1 P1 + 1 P2 (fixed), round 3 VERDICT: pass with zero findings.
- Residual risks: Phase B aggregate Success Criteria 1-3 miss their thresholds; adjudicated as documented partial, not a defect — the miss concentrates entirely in two scenarios that are prompt-instructed ceremony or legitimately floor-promoted past lite mid-session, while the true-lite bucket meets the ratios (1.076x duration vs strict, 1.334x tokens vs no-harness, 0 ceremony artifacts). Promotion-time envelope projection (B3), criteria re-bucketing, scenario prompt fix, and the 20→≤5 facade deletion are recorded as deferred follow-ups in `tasks/todos.md`.
- Reviewer action required: none.
- Rollback: revert the ordered phase commits; `sync:hooks`/`check:hooks` restore hook parity; benchmark reports are evidence-only and restore from git; D1 retirement paths never delete unowned or modified host content.

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: approved work-package plan executed in isolated `codex/harness-kernel-optimization-phase2` worktree; phase-per-worker delegation (fast-worker), read-only explorer verification, gatekeeper acceptance.
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: P1 mapped the phase-1 kernel authorities plus cross-model (GPT) review findings; P2 traced the apply_patch expansion, state resolution, SessionStart injection, benchmark, and installer paths end to end (including a live reproduction of the batch-scope bypass); P3 fixed inputs to existing single authorities without adding classifiers, aliases, or dual authority.
- Root cause or plan evidence: plan Evidence Baseline ("Verified guard gap", "Threshold input gaps"); Root Cause Evidence in contract (pre-fix artifact `.ai/harness/runs/phase2-a1-prefix-failure.txt`, PRE_FIX_EXIT=1).

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: represented by the gatekeeper acceptance pass (independent re-run of all required checks + implementation spot-checks on A1/C1/C2/D1).
- Commands run: every contract `commands_succeed` entry, re-run independently by the gate this session; `repo-harness run check-task-workflow --strict` exits 1 only on the pre-existing external [BrainSync] drift documented in notes (environmental, path untouched by this branch).
- Manual checks: authoritative benchmark report `authoritative:true`, 27/27, run `f6684c28` bound to source commit `900854ff`; facade retirement disposable-HOME smokes (retire-on-source-gone, preserve-on-modified, gptpro profile matrix) pass; no real HOME touched.
- Supporting artifacts: `evals/harness/reports/profile-comparison.{json,md}`, `.ai/harness/runs/phase2-a1-prefix-failure.txt`, implementation notes (all phases + deviations).
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes.
- Run snapshot: generated by `repo-harness run verify-sprint` closeout.

## External Acceptance Advice

> **External Acceptance**: pass

- P1 blockers: none
- Acceptance history: round 1 (session 019f5c15) 4 P1 + 4 P2 -> fixed/adjudicated in a629bafe, 86bba78c, f16eef81; round 2 (session 019f5c1b via 019f5c5e) 1 P1 + 1 P2 -> fixed in 5e47fc3c; round 3 (session 019f5c90) VERDICT: pass, zero findings against code state 5e47fc3c.
- Post-acceptance delta: workflow bookkeeping only (d080e009 acceptance record, ebde0659 contract allowed-paths amendment for comment-only cross-references); `git diff 5e47fc3c..HEAD --name-only` shows exactly the contract and this review file, zero code change since the accepted state.
- P2 advisories: Phase B aggregate criteria miss (adjudicated, deferred follow-up recorded); `artifactCount` in run-skill-evals.ts shares the structurally-null pattern E3 removed (flagged in notes, not in scope).
- Acceptance checklist: scope-traced diff, re-run verification, spot-checked implementations, fail-closed semantics preserved, no test fakery.

## Behavior Diff Notes

- A 4-file `apply_patch` now resolves the workflow profile against its full batch scope on every recursive check (was: per-file lite bypass; live-reproduced pre-fix).
- `state resolve --field workflow_profile` collapses the edit-guard hot path to one Bun start per invocation.
- `[HarnessState]`/ceremony guidance is profile-bound at the resolver: lite = zero ceremony, standard = active plan only, strict = full envelope (text layer only; floor and guards unchanged).
- Invalid/declared-missing capability registry now blocks with `capability_registry:invalid` instead of silently resolving zero capabilities; unmapped paths fold in as one extra bucket.
- Medium-scope path counting excludes workflow surfaces (docs-only batches resolve lite); shell/TS predicate parity is drift-checked by `check:hooks`.
- Host facade dirs whose canonical source is gone are retired (owner-marked, unmodified only); `repo-harness status` reads back the installed profile.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Deferred (tasks/todos.md): promotion-time deterministic envelope projection + benchmark criteria re-bucketing + scenario prompt fix; skill facade convergence 20→≤5 with README x5 / evals / content-contract-test migration (D1 plumbing is the landed precondition).
- Environmental: [BrainSync] external-tooling drift from a concurrent session; hook-diet p95 probe fails on cold-cache worktrees (pre-existing, documented in Phase A notes).

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 9/10 | All shipped phases verified end to end; B's aggregate benchmark target intentionally lands as documented partial |
| Product depth | 8/10 | Root-caused the lite cost story to promotion-time envelope authoring; honest deferral instead of a workaround |
| Design quality | 9/10 | Single-authority fixes only: no new classifier, no alias, no dual benchmark authority; fail-closed semantics tightened, not loosened |
| Code quality | 9/10 | TDD with pre-fix artifacts; drift checks verified in both directions; disposable-HOME smokes for host mutation paths |

## Failing Items

- none blocking; see Residual Risks for adjudicated partials and deferrals.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test`; `bun run check:hooks`; `bash scripts/check-architecture-sync.sh`; `repo-harness run verify-sprint`.
- Re-check: `evals/harness/reports/profile-comparison.json` `authoritative:true` + 27/27; `.ai/harness/runs/phase2-a1-prefix-failure.txt` PRE_FIX_EXIT=1.

## Summary

- PASS. Phases A/B/C/D1/E landed with evidence-bound verification; the batch-scope guard bypass is fixed with a live pre-fix reproduction artifact; threshold inputs are hardened fail-closed; ceremony guidance is bound to the deterministic profile floor; retirement plumbing unblocks the deferred facade convergence. Phase B's aggregate benchmark criteria remain a documented partial with the true-lite bucket passing, adjudicated and deferred to a scoped follow-up.
