- Summary: Gatekeeper acceptance for issue #161: cleanupExpiredClients() and load() share one isRemovableClient() predicate that exempts a past-TTL client only while it holds an unexpired access token, or an unexpired refresh token resolving to an access-token record it owns. Scope matches contract allowed_paths with no out-of-scope edits. Security boundary verified: /authorize is passphrase-gated (src/cli/mcp/transports/http.ts:680), so unauthenticated spam registrations never obtain tokens and are still cleaned at 30 days; zombie access+refresh pairs stay removable; malformed client_id_issued_at remains an unconditional delete. Pre-fix RED artifact shows PRE_FIX_EXIT=1 with only the two keep-alive cases failing. verify-sprint 16/16 Fulfilled, bun test 587922ms green, bun run check:type green.
- Findings: none
