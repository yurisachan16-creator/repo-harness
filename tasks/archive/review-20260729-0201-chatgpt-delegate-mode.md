## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass (gatekeeper VERDICT: PASS, zero blocking findings)
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: SKILL.md router line + triggers + boundary note; new references/delegate.md; .gitignore delegations line; skill-surface pin (REFERENCES + byte limit, contract-authorized); contract/plan/notes/review/todos workflow artifacts
- Actual files changed: exactly the intended set (9 paths, goal-manifest mapped one-to-one, no unauthorized extras)
- Commands passed: bun test (full 2089 pass/0 fail in round 2; targeted 28 pass/0 fail re-run by gatekeeper), check-architecture-sync, check-task-sync, check-task-workflow --strict, adopt --dry-run, both rg exit-criteria asserts, verify-sprint 13/13 Fulfilled
- Residual risks: Canary B (Codex IAB transport) not yet exercised — handoff pending user Codex session; engine meta projection gap for oracle >=0.16 (conversationUrl/modelSelection) deferred to todos with transport-native evidence join documented in delegate.md
- Reviewer action required: none beyond merge decision
- Rollback: revert commit d88be107 (skill-layer + workflow artifacts only, no state/schema migration)

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: repo-harness contract worktree execution in `/Users/ancienttwo/Projects/repo-harness-wt-chatgpt-delegate-mode` (plan-to-todo via capture-plan --execute), four delegated worker rounds + read-only gatekeeper final review.
- P1 map: ChatGPT integration authority already lives in `assets/skills/repo-harness-chatgpt/` (router + 5 mode references) over `src/cli/chatgpt-browser/` (engine, oracle default / native deprecated) and 5 opt-in MCP tools; delegate mode extends the skill layer only.
- P2 trace: delegate brief -> bundle staged under `.ai/harness/chatgpt/delegations/<stamp>-<slug>/bundle/` -> engine file-policy gate (path allow/deny, binary, 512KB, max-inline-chars) -> `browser-consult` (oracle >=0.16, Pro verified at picker) -> write-output answer authority -> sentinel envelope cut -> isolated-worktree acceptance chain.
- P3 decision rationale: one repo-owned protocol with two explicit host transports, no auto-fallback, no third browser control surface; skill-surface pin updated (not circumvented) under contract authority; engine changes deliberately deferred to ledgered todos.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: covered by gatekeeper read-only review (diff-vs-goal, factual accuracy vs file-policy source, real command re-runs).
- Commands run: see Human Review Card; verify-sprint --prepare-acceptance 13/13 Fulfilled after removing the framework-forbidden evidence-producer exit criterion (adopt --dry-run stays in root required checks, ran green).
- Manual checks: delegate.md factual audit against `src/cli/chatgpt-browser/file-policy.ts` (allow/deny lists verbatim), no stale "secret scanner"/"zip upload" wording, EXECUTION_BOUNDARY present in the task-brief template.
- Supporting artifacts: Canary A evidence in primary checkout — sessions `chgpt_20260729_013746_*` (real Pro consult; transport-native `modelSelection.verified=true`, conversationId captured) and `chgpt_20260729_014227_followup-*` (lineage + sentinel intact); probes PROBE1/3/4 exit codes recorded in notes.
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes — four-round decision history, pin-widening rationale, byte-limit sizing, canary/probe evidence.
- Run snapshot: .ai/harness/runs/run-20260729T015828-24581-20260729-0106-chatgpt-delegate-mode.json

- Summary: Gatekeeper reviewed the full worktree diff against the contract goal manifest: 9 change paths all mapped, no unauthorized extras; delegate.md factually consistent with file-policy source and canary/probe evidence; skill-surface pin update covered by contract revision; targeted tests 28 pass/0 fail, task-sync and strict workflow checks green; Canary A (doctor, path-policy probes, real Pro consult with picker-level model verification and captured conversationUrl, followup lineage with intact sentinel) all passed.
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- New delegate mode is opt-in and router-discovered only; consult mode's planning-only boundary is restated, not relaxed.
- Skill-surface pin now declares 6 references and a 2560-byte router limit; drift detection semantics unchanged.
- No engine/runtime behavior change; `.gitignore` gains one runtime-evidence path.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- T7 Canary B (Codex built-in browser) pending user Codex session; instructions handed off with the PR.
- Deferred (tasks/todos.md): engine projection of oracle >=0.16 conversationUrl/modelSelection into BrowserSessionMeta; delegate-specific read posture to skip bundle staging.
- T8 archive-workflow after merge.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 9/10 | Claude transport fully canaried end-to-end; Codex transport specified but not yet exercised (T7) |
| Product depth | 9/10 | 15-rule protocol covers packaging, waiting, recovery, acceptance, escalation, and reporting with evidence-backed corrections |
| Design quality | 9/10 | Single repo-owned authority, two explicit host transports, fail-closed throughout, no fallback tracks |
| Code quality | 9/10 | Docs-and-pin change; matches existing reference style; tests green; pin update justified and commented |

## Failing Items

- none

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `REPO_HARNESS_SOURCE_ROOT=$PWD repo-harness run verify-sprint` in the worktree; `bun test tests/skill-surface/chatgpt-package.test.ts tests/workflow-contract.test.ts tests/scaffold-parity.test.ts`
- Re-check: `repo-harness chatgpt browser-doctor --repo . --provider oracle --json` (status ready, oracle >=0.16)

## Summary

- Delegate mode ships as a skill-layer work package: repo-owned 15-rule dual-agent GPT Pro protocol plus explicit Claude(oracle)/Codex(IAB) transports, verified by full gates and a real Pro round-trip canary; engine projection work is ledgered, not smuggled in.
