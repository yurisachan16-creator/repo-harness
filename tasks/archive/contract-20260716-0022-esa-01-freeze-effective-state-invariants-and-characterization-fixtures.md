## Why

The current Effective State implementation combines authority parsing, deterministic policy, Git/version effects, lock/cache persistence, and adapter projection. Moving it without a frozen behavioral oracle risks silently changing blockers, freshness, versions, CLI exits, or concurrency safety.

## Goal

Freeze Effective State v1 at `main@82550779cdccf0575d674ae53bbc95ba63e44743` with reusable real-repository fixtures, at least ten full normalized direct/CLI/hook goldens, lock/cache/source-instability tests, an authority ADR, and a recorded 100-resolution median/p95 baseline. Public protocol, command/tool names, ordering, exits, and valid-input semantics remain unchanged; review-proven authority-read, locking, and publication failures must be corrected fail closed.

Then execute the approved dependent rows ESA-02 through ESA-05 and ESA-07 in order on the same isolated branch, leaving ESA-06 deferred. ESA-07 includes the minimal evidence-producer correction required to make every harness-enabled provider write into the linked workspace read by its grader. Produce one successful repository-wide authoritative benchmark after the final code freeze, then close the Sprint and merge/push `main`.

## Scope

- In scope: ESA-01 through ESA-05 plus ESA-07 files and tests named by the approved Sprint, the bounded benchmark linked-worktree topology correction, and synchronized workflow artifacts.
- Out of scope: ESA-06 writer hardening, benchmark scenarios/graders/provider semantics/fingerprint validation, unrelated tools, the two no-touch Skill Surface files, and the unapproved Harness Loop plan in the main checkout.
- Taste constraints: no new abstraction beyond a shared test fixture used by the existing suite and new characterization suites; no fallback or second authority.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop if satisfying a golden requires an unreviewed semantic delta from baseline; explicit fail-closed correctness fixes require a reproduced fault and regression proof.
- Stop if an edit is required outside `allowed_paths`.
- Stop if lock/source-mutation evidence cannot be made bounded and deterministic enough to distinguish stable publication from fail-closed behavior.
- Stop if an existing valid-input Effective State assertion changes expected behavior.
- Stop if benchmark recovery requires changing scenario prompts, acceptance commands, grader semantics, product source, or fingerprint/hash validation.

## Falsifier

The direction is wrong if current behavior cannot be captured without weakening exact blocker/reason/order/version/hash contracts, if real Git/lock fixtures expose nondeterministic semantic output, or if provider output and grader authority cannot share one precreated linked workspace without changing evaluator semantics. Cheapest topology proof: run the focused matrix regression before the runner patch.

```

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: behavior-preserving authority cutover for ESA-01..05 and ESA-07; Effective State protocol `1`, CLI/MCP names, and exit semantics stay stable.
- Edge cases: missing/foreign authority, stale projections, invalid risk/capability inputs, cache deletion/corruption, live/stale locks, changing sources.
- Regression risks: over-normalized goldens or test-only fixture drift.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: isolated branch `codex/esa-01-freeze-effective-state-invariants-and-characterization-fixtures`.
- Revert strategy: revert the ESA-01 commit or discard the isolated branch; no migration required.
