## P1/P2/P3 Decisions

- P1: pure artifact, state, workflow-profile, and capability-registry rules now live under `src/core`; repository/Git/lock/version/cache operations live under `src/effects`; CLI, hook, and MCP surfaces are adapters. Repository artifacts remain authority; cache and `tasks/current.md` remain replaceable projections.
- P2: risk input enters the CLI adapter, the effectful resolver locks and collects an exact source-hash set, pure core projects state, and a second read proves stability. A Git-common-dir lock then covers the entire publication transaction: publish the rollback-capable cache first and commit the version owner last. CLI follows requested risk; hook/MCP follow fixed inspect policy while sharing repository authority.
- P3: preserve protocol `1`, command/tool names, CLI ordering/exits, and 0.10.x compatibility; remove the retired authoring paths in the same cutover. No feature flag, dual parser, semantic fallback, or alternate authority was added. ESA-06 writer semantics remain deferred.

## Authority And Packaging Decisions

- `interfaces/effective-state-v1.ts` is the packed protocol boundary; `interfaces/types.ts` re-exports it.
- Workflow profile moved from the hook adapter to `src/core/workflow/profile.ts` with no compatibility re-export.
- Capability-registry parsing, validation, diagnostics, normalization, and longest-prefix matching have one canonical core owner. The adopted helper is generated as a typed standalone source projection with a canonical source hash; the checker never executes target-owned scripts.
- `src/cli/hook/state-snapshot.ts` is a compatibility projection only. Git review-subject observation moved to `src/effects/review/diff-fingerprint.ts`, with a CLI runner at `src/cli/hook/review-subject.ts`; the boundary gate rejects Effects-to-CLI reverse imports.
- MCP uses the canonical effectful resolver. Its tool annotation is `readOnlyHint: false` because exact durable `state_version` parity materializes ignored cache/version read models. The retained redacted `tasks/current.md` preview and MCP policy profile are explicitly labeled non-authoritative/additive.

## Concurrency Invariants

- Repository-local resolution uses an exclusive lock directory and a newly generated token filename for each acquisition attempt. Reclaim observes one exact token, confirms stale/dead ownership, rechecks directory and token inode identity, unlinks only that filename, then relies on `rmdir` to fail closed if another token appeared.
- Repository and Git-common-dir roots are canonical real directories. Every intermediate lock ancestor is created one level at a time, rejected if it is a symlink/non-directory, and bound by `dev/ino`; ancestors are rechecked before token publication and before `run()`.
- A live or unknown token is never reclaimed: malformed fallback parses the PID from the production token filename and reclaims only a confirmed-dead PID; `EPERM` is treated as alive. Before `run()`, the acquirer rechecks the original directory `dev/ino`, sole token filename, and owner inode.
- An empty directory cannot distinguish a crashed creator from a live creator paused between `mkdir` and token publication. It is therefore never auto-reclaimed, regardless of mtime; timeout plus verified operator cleanup is the explicit availability recovery path.
- `state_version` ownership and its allocation lock live in the Git common-dir. A repo-local resolver lock is deliberately not used as the linked-worktree serialization authority.
- Subprocess proofs cover both invariants: twelve simultaneous stale reclaimers never exceed one critical owner; an aged empty pre-token creator completes before the contender enters; a production-shaped live/reused-PID token reaches the real 5-second fail-closed timeout without deletion; twelve publishers split across linked worktrees return versions `1..12` and leave one common-dir owner at `12`.

## Characterization And Fault Evidence

- Twelve full normalized golden records retain stable source hashes and Git revisions exactly. Tests independently derive file hashes, `authority_revision`, and `state_revision`. Real CLI subprocesses match requested-risk resolution; real hook subprocess and MCP public dispatch match direct inspect resolution; repository authority fields remain identical across the intentional policy delta.
- Non-`ENOENT` authority reads fail closed. Fault tests cover plan/policy/registry `EACCES`, malformed and parseable-invalid policy, authoritative paths that become directories, cache temp/publish failure, owner temp/publish failure, symlink ancestors, token replacement, dead/malformed/live owners, deleted/corrupt cache, and continuous capability-registry mutation.
- Policy and capability-registry files participate in `source_hashes`; resolver-owned policy fields are eagerly validated even for clean inspect/no-target calls. Sequential mutation advances revision/version, while continuous mutation or any cache/owner fault publishes no partial authority and consumes no version.
- The third and final repair round closes the remaining platform/error-boundary gaps: policy-owned paths must be contained under both POSIX and Win32 grammars, `safeRealpath` degrades only explicit `ENOENT`, Git version reads return `0` only when discovery metadata is actually absent, and the unused standalone cache-writer export is removed so fault injection uses the resolver transaction seam.
- The bounded external finding pass confirmed two additional invariants. Every artifact-derived read now crosses one POSIX/Win32 lexical and canonical repository-containment check; an existing external symlink target or an `ENOENT` target whose nearest existing ancestor resolves outside aborts before cache/version publication. `state_revision` sorts source-hash keys by explicit code-unit order rather than host locale/ICU collation.
- The ESA-01 baseline benchmark at `main@82550779cdccf0575d674ae53bbc95ba63e44743` recorded median `223.197 ms` and p95 `270.589 ms`, giving a +10% p95 budget of `297.648 ms`. On clean source commit `26dd6e88ea7c5fcf1a80439044283e98d892da41`, the single final 100-resolution run recorded median `169.460 ms` and p95 `241.095 ms`: p95 is 10.900% below baseline and 56.553 ms inside the budget. The earlier 170.305/215.574 calibration remains invalid pre-freeze evidence.

## Focused Verification To Date

- Benchmark topology regression failed before the patch with 24 pass / 1 fail because Adaptive Lite's grader workspace had `.git` rather than `.git/worktrees/*`. After changing only the arm overlay condition, `bun test tests/harness-benchmark-matrix.test.ts` passes 25/25 with 141 assertions; No Harness stays primary, Adaptive Lite and Strict are linked, and only Strict receives projected plan/contract inputs. Type, architecture sync, task sync, and `git diff --check` pass.
- `bun run check:type`: pass.
- Pre-third-round relevant matrix: `bun test tests/state tests/effective-state.test.ts tests/runtime-profile-enforcement.test.ts tests/capabilities tests/cli/state-command.test.ts tests/cli/state-snapshot.test.ts tests/cli/mcp-tools.test.ts`: 167 pass, 0 fail, 1,500 assertions across 12 files in 89.39 seconds; it is not the final source evidence after the last narrow delta.
- Third-round focused matrix: `bun test tests/effective-state.test.ts tests/state/state-effects.test.ts tests/cli/state-snapshot.test.ts`: 71 pass, 0 fail, 251 assertions. Windows traversal, worktree-owner `ELOOP`, explicit non-Git version `0`, corrupt Git discovery fail-closed, transaction faults, and baseline snapshot behavior pass.
- Bounded post-Claude repair: `bun test tests/effective-state.test.ts tests/state/state-effects.test.ts` passes 68/68 with 233 assertions; type, state-boundary, and diff checks pass. Exact-subject reverify passes at `sha256:0fafc7842f061be82446de601361b9559644d672d0adbdc304843a80e4ee53c6`, target `af6d5216c2cd5adf2f672636a8308a309f0f5adb`, overlap `0`. It replays POSIX/Win32 traversal, existing external symlink, missing-final/external-ancestor symlink, ordinary in-repo absence, and Unicode insertion-order cases.
- Earlier unified repair subset: `bun test tests/effective-state.test.ts tests/state/state-effects.test.ts tests/state/state-concurrency.test.ts`: 72 pass, 0 fail after the second repair round.
- `bun test tests/effective-state.test.ts tests/state/state-effects.test.ts tests/state/state-concurrency.test.ts tests/state/adapter-parity.test.ts tests/cli/state-command.test.ts tests/cli/state-snapshot.test.ts`: 97 pass, 0 fail before the final eager-policy and evidence-hardening delta; every changed subset was subsequently reverified. A separate 86/86 checkpoint preceded one test-fixture correction and is not final evidence.
- `bun test tests/runtime-profile-enforcement.test.ts -t "patch spanning two capability prefixes"`: pass after replacing an obsolete simplified registry fixture with a valid canonical registry record.
- `bun run check:hooks`, `bun run check:helpers`, and `bun run check:state-boundaries`: pass; projection hashes remain `sha256:a28c881fdbbff56ab039140c355bf468ca7b2451ae34a6a372d99972efc6f53f` and `sha256:5b82b946bb37c6ce1ea69f8e1e117f849326ce55ec8bfa741f38c6f50c8edf08`, with 102 TypeScript files checked. `git diff --check`, architecture sync, and task sync also pass.
- Earlier frozen slices: state core 27 pass; adapter/golden/CLI 33 pass; effective-state integration 35 pass; capability/config/architecture 27 pass; helper/boundary 13 pass; generated hook/helper drift checks pass.
- On clean source commit `26dd6e88`, packed `repo-harness-0.10.1.tgz` installs and its packaged CLI bins start.
- The authoritative 27/27 Harness report and 100-resolution numbers bound to source commit `26dd6e88ea7c5fcf1a80439044283e98d892da41` became historical after the bounded repository-containment/revision repair changed the source subject. They are retained for audit but are not final evidence for the new freeze; final evidence must be produced once after the replacement subject is clean and accepted.
- The first replacement matrix stopped at Adaptive Lite cross-capability: Codex correctly attempted the Strict worktree path after runtime promotion, but `workspace-write` could not create the required Git ref; its concurrent database sibling had a passing 1/1 grader before intentional fail-fast cancellation. A single bounded Claude recovery created a linked worktree and passed the cross-capability focused test there, but the provider output remained outside the primary workspace read by the grader; the database sibling was then cancelled. This proves one evaluator topology defect, not an Effective State/product regression.
- ESA-07 is amended only to precreate the grader's linked workspace for every harness-enabled arm. Scenario prompts, graders, provider policy, product source, and the broader Harness Loop remain unchanged.
- Final authoritative evidence was produced exactly once after the topology patch from clean frozen HEAD `606b02c17348dfb2085575d136fae1d38ea5728d`. Run `c88767c6-bf6e-4425-be8b-02e275141d8b` used `codex-cli 0.144.4`; all 27 provider executions, expected-path checks, and graders passed across No Harness, Adaptive Lite, and Strict. The report subject is `sha256:c2c55a74bcb67448451f57fa10a8c6f2fe8f195992d2969b153781ce89e0d640`; its byte-bound evidence is `sha256:4dc0944c44d337948ae98a59710ea982810af47c00813a99937ebd2300572658`.
- `bun scripts/validate-harness-profile-benchmark.ts --report evals/harness/reports/profile-comparison.json --require-authoritative --format json` returned `status=pass`, `profile_base_count=3`, and `arm_count=27`. The source HEAD remained `606b02c1` throughout execution, and afterward exactly the three allowed `profile-comparison.{json,md,sha256.json}` artifacts were modified.
- The first full release-gate run executed 1,592 tests and exposed one stale test contract: `tests/helper-scripts.test.ts` still required byte identity for `capability-resolver.ts` even though ESA-04 deliberately made the repository script a canonical-core adapter and the packaged helper a standalone, source-hash-bound projection. The fix changes only that test's explicit divergence allowlist; `tests/capability-resolver.test.ts` and `check:helpers` remain the dedicated content, runtime, type, and source-hash proof.
- The bounded helper-contract reverify passes the exact helper test, all 9 standalone capability-resolver tests, and the 49-helper drift gate. The second full `bun run check:release` then passes with 1,591 tests passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed, 14,048 assertions, `[ci] OK`, and `[release] OK`; its tarball smoke installs `repo-harness-0.10.1.tgz` and starts the packaged CLI binaries. No production or benchmark-subject file changed after `606b02c1`.
- The first strict closeout attempt through the installed helper was infrastructure-inconclusive because its fixed 120-second wrapper timed out before `verify-sprint.sh` returned. The repo-local verifier then completed all implementation and command criteria, including another `check:release` pass in `518.933s`, and exposed only contract metadata defects: directory names are invalid `tests_pass` entries, and seven manual criteria lacked the required exact checked evidence rows. The bounded metadata repair expands those directories to their real test files and records concrete evidence in the review; it retains the full `check:release` criterion and does not change product or benchmark bytes.
- The pre-refactor full suite recorded 1493 pass, 1 skip, 0 fail. It is historical characterization, not final release evidence.

## Review Findings Closed

- Closed linked-worktree lost updates by moving version ownership and allocation locking to the Git common-dir.
- Closed static ancestor redirection and flat-file pathname TOCTOU with canonical roots, stepwise no-symlink ancestors, directory-token ownership, exact-token deletion, inode checks, liveness checks, and pre-run exclusivity validation.
- Closed the unsafe empty-directory reclaim rule by preserving every pre-token empty directory fail-closed; PID reuse remains an explicit manual-recovery availability condition rather than an invented cross-platform identity heuristic.
- Closed version/cache partial publication with a common-lock transaction, cache rollback, and version-owner-last commit point; cold/warm and linked-worktree fault injection proves no consumed version.
- Closed plan/policy/registry fail-open reads: only `ENOENT` means absent, resolver-owned policy metadata is eagerly validated, and permission/malformed inputs publish neither cache nor owner.
- Replaced injected adapter "parity" with real CLI/hook/MCP public paths and named the intentional requested-risk versus fixed-inspect policy boundary.
- Closed Win32 backslash traversal in policy-owned paths, worktree/common-dir error swallowing, and the zero-caller standalone cache publication bypass; direct cache fault tests now exercise only the resolver transaction seam.
- Closed repository escape across active-plan, review, sprint, and pending-draft artifact paths with one canonical read choke point; lexical traversal, external targets, and external nearest-existing ancestors all fail closed. Closed locale-dependent state revisions with explicit code-unit ordering and an insertion-order regression.
- Closed hidden MCP mutation by advertising the actual effectful contract and testing cache/version materialization.
- Closed arbitrary target-script execution in the boundary checker; it performs static/source-hash validation only.
- Closed Effects-to-CLI reverse dependency and expanded the durable checker to reject the actual migrated legacy artifact-authority names.

## Deviations And Tradeoffs

- The approved Sprint proposed `0.11.0` only if ESA-06 mandatory overwrite preconditions shipped. ESA-06 remains deferred, so this cutover is the non-breaking `0.10.1` release surface and is not published or tagged by this task.
- The standalone helper changed from a runtime Bun bundle to a deterministic typed source projection because bundling erased the public type surface needed by adopted repositories. It remains a generated projection of one canonical implementation.
- Exact MCP `state_version` parity cannot be guaranteed by a number-only read without materializing the durable read model. The MCP tool therefore declares the write accurately instead of introducing a speculative counter or compatibility shape.
- The frozen-subject benchmark, helper-contract repair, and full release/package gate are complete. Exact-subject external acceptance, strict workflow finish, PR checks, merge, and remote-main verification remain pending.

## Deferred Scope

- ESA-06 guarded workflow-artifact writer and overwrite-precondition semantics remain unmodified and unclaimed.
- PID reuse can make a genuinely stale token look live to `kill(pid, 0)`. This is fail-closed mutual-exclusion behavior with a bounded timeout and verified manual cleanup requirement, not an automatic liveness guarantee; no FFI/native runtime dependency was added.
- Active hostile rename of a validated ancestor after the final `lstat` remains outside the portable Node/Bun proof because the runtime exposes no `openat`/dirfd primitive. The accepted threat boundary requires canonical ancestors not be actively renamed during a held lock; static/intermediate symlink redirection is rejected and regression-tested.
- Non-blocking P3: legacy hook-only `StateSnapshot` facts (`spec`, `pending`, evidence, and contract path) are read after canonical Effective State stability is established, so a concurrent edit can make those compatibility-only fields reflect the next instant. Canonical plan/profile/blockers remain shared-state projections. If the snapshot contract is changed later, bundle these facts into the same stable observation rather than widening this cutover.
- The untracked Skill Surface and Harness Loop artifacts in the main checkout are outside this work-package and remain no-touch.
- Benchmark subject fingerprint coverage does not currently include every transitive `src/effects` runtime byte. This remains verification debt. The present closeout instead requires the successful report `source_commit` to equal the frozen clean HEAD recorded immediately before the run, requires source HEAD to remain unchanged while the run writes only its expected report artifacts, and records that equality with the exact normalized review subject; the old `26dd6e88` report is never reusable for this freeze.
