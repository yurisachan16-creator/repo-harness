## Why

Long-run continuation is safe only when the documented tick can be executed
literally and destructive closeout has exactly one owner. The completed
anti-drift sprint currently has three acceptance gaps: the receipt ordering
asks for an after-token before it exists, the conformance fixture bypasses
public command sequencing, and concurrent finish/ship processes can both pass
the journal's check-then-act guard. Shipping that state turns recovery and
stall protection into single-host conventions instead of enforced contracts.

## Goal

Make the continuation protocol executable as written, make its disposable-repo
proof exercise the public host command order, and make finish/ship closeout
single-owner before any lifecycle or external effect. Preserve Effective State
and the Sprint marker as the only next-work authority, then refresh and smoke
the installed CLI after source verification passes.

## Scope

- In scope: Git-common-dir closeout ownership for finish and ship; explicit
  recovery interaction with that ownership; concurrent regression coverage;
  tick ordering; conformance command/gate sequencing; durable research wording;
  source and installed-runtime verification.
- Out of scope: scheduler, daemon, timer, quota/token ledger, journal GC,
  automatic stale-lock reclaim, automatic crash resume, new task authority,
  compatibility aliases, release publishing, and unrelated deferred goals.
- Taste constraints: one owner and one authority per datum; fail closed instead
  of guessing; use existing shell/helper boundaries; keep source/template helper
  projections byte-identical; do not add a second transaction abstraction.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

- Direction is falsified if two same-worktree closeouts can both cross the owner
  boundary or either loser reaches lifecycle, merge, push, or shared journal
  writes. Cheapest proof: an adversarial two-process fixture held at the claim
  boundary before production implementation.
- Direction is falsified if conformance still passes after deleting or
  reordering an envelope-named command or documented gate step.
- Deployment closure is falsified if the refreshed installed CLI still lacks
  `state next` or `state attempt`.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: `scripts/contract-worktree.sh:572-638` and its ship/template mirror perform a non-atomic scan-before-mkdir journal begin, while `docs/reference-configs/long-run-continuation.md:15-16` records a receipt before the closing envelope that supplies its required after token.
- repro: run two same-worktree `contract-worktree finish --merge` processes while the first is paused before journal begin, and separately follow the documented tick using only observed envelope tokens.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: exactly one same-worktree closeout owns finish/ship;
  receipt tokens are captured envelope-to-envelope; conformance executes public
  command order; installed CLI smoke passes after refresh.
- Edge cases: simultaneous begin before status publication, SIGKILL leaving an
  owner claim, explicit abort/reconcile, completed replay, and stable
  no-progress halt after receipt publication.
- Regression risks: a lock that becomes a second recovery authority, automatic
  stale reclaim, helper projection drift, or a conformance stub that can pass
  without executing the public protocol.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: baseline `737dcdce3668abd63d5fb9381a74a04d4ebb8322`.
- Revert strategy: revert the isolated `codex/long-run-conformance-closure`
  commit; if user-level CLI refresh fails, reinstall the prior `0.12.2` package.
