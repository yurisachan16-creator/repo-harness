## Why

The current ship boundary trusts review and check artifacts but does not invoke or verify a single semantic gatekeeper verdict bound to the exact merge candidate. Without a fail-closed receipt, an agent-driven flow can accidentally merge after HEAD or the diff moves, or bypass the intended gatekeeper entirely.

## Goal

Install one local, read-only merge-gate protocol and require the ship orchestrator to produce and verify a PASS receipt bound to the repository, target base SHA, candidate head SHA, and diff fingerprint before a contract worktree can be pushed or merged.

## Scope

- In scope: a concise `merge-gate` skill; one local Claude gatekeeper runner contract; deterministic receipt generation/validation; ship-worktrees fail-closed enforcement; runtime skill installation; focused tests; architecture and workflow projections.
- Out of scope: GitHub App/check-run publication, hosted execution, provider fallback, compatibility receipt shapes, changes to worker agents, and unrelated agent-fleet model routing.
- Taste constraints: Keep the agent runtime wrapper thin. The skill owns review semantics; the orchestrator owns receipt persistence and all repository mutations.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.

## Falsifier

The direction is wrong if a valid receipt cannot be deterministically invalidated by changing only HEAD or the base-to-head diff. The cheapest proof is a fixture that reuses one PASS receipt after a new commit and must fail before any ship side effect.

## Root Cause Evidence

Required when Task Profile is `bugfix`; leave as-is otherwise.

- root_cause: one sentence naming file:line/condition (testable, not "a state issue").
- repro: the command or UI path that reproduces the symptom.
- regression_guard: path to a test that fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix (must also appear under exit_criteria.tests_pass).
- pre_fix_failure_artifact: path to a captured run of regression_guard on the UNFIXED code. Capture with `bun test <regression_guard> > <artifact> 2>&1; echo "PRE_FIX_EXIT=$?" >> <artifact>` (no pipes — pipes swallow the exit status). The gate requires a non-zero `PRE_FIX_EXIT=` line plus the regression_guard path string in the artifact (see the Root Cause Evidence Gate section in docs/reference-configs/sprint-contracts.md).

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260714-1713-merge-gate-enforcement.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260714-1713-merge-gate-enforcement.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20260714-1713-merge-gate-enforcement.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: `repo-harness run verify-sprint` must see this contract pass, the review recommend pass, and `## External Acceptance Advice` pass or record a manual override.

```

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: PASS receipts are generated by the orchestrator from strict JSON output and verified immediately before ship side effects.
- Edge cases: missing runner, malformed output, FAIL/BLOCKED, moved HEAD, changed diff, wrong repository, and stale base all fail closed.
- Regression risks: downstream helper projection and skill installation must remain byte-identical and host-scoped.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: the single merge-gate enforcement commit for this work-package.
- Revert strategy: revert the skill, runner/verifier, ship integration, policy, projection, and tests together.
