## Why

gstack is embedded in canonical workflow semantics even though repo-harness does not own its lifecycle or interaction contract. That makes an advisory external tool a hidden planning authority: a host capability mismatch can block architecture work that the parent agent can complete. The clean target is one lifecycle owner: the parent agent uses `geju` to open the frame, completes P1/P2/P3 itself, and freezes the accepted direction into the plan and contract.

## Goal

Remove gstack completely from repo-harness active product, runtime, generated-policy, tooling-readiness, and current documentation surfaces. Product discovery and complex/design planning must route to the parent-agent path with `geju` pre-contract framing. Fresh init and canonical stale-policy adoption carrying the removed external complex-route declaration must produce the new route directly, with no aliases, fallback provider, deprecation branch, dual authority, or preserved gstack compatibility value.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Replace canonical workflow-contract and policy planning routes with parent-agent ownership plus `geju` pre-contract framing.
  - Update managed adoption behavior so retired canonical planning-provider values do not survive a stale-policy adoption.
  - Update `repo-harness-plan`, generated root instructions, active architecture/reference docs, migration guidance, README translations, initializer copy, and exact parity tests.
  - Delete gstack detection, report output, host metadata, install/update probes, and commands from source and packaged tooling helpers.
  - Add focused regression coverage for fresh generation, stale adoption, tooling JSON/text output, and active-surface removal.
  - Preserve source/mirror equality for workflow contract, ensure-task-workflow, check-agent-tooling, and reference-config assets.
- Out of scope:
  - User-local installations under `~/.claude/skills/` or `~/.codex/skills/`; repository authority does not uninstall them.
  - Waza, gbrain, CodeGraph, hai-stack, `geju`, agent-fleet identity telemetry, or model/profile routing.
  - The independent `harness-kernel-optimization-phase2` worktree and its files.
  - Rewriting archived plans/tasks or dated research evidence that records historical decisions.
- Taste constraints: delete the provider concept instead of renaming it; keep parent-agent lifecycle ownership explicit; do not introduce compatibility code or a new provider abstraction.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and hand back to the parent if the change would require editing a path outside Allowed Paths.
- Stop if an Exit Criteria command cannot be run in this environment.
- Stop if Goal, Scope, or Exit Criteria are internally contradictory.
- Stop if a current executable/public contract is discovered that can only satisfy acceptance through gstack; record the exact path and behavior before widening scope.

## Falsifier

A current executable repo-harness feature or public contract that can only satisfy its acceptance criteria through gstack, and cannot be expressed through parent-agent + `geju` + P1/P2/P3, would falsify the direction. The cheapest proof is the end-to-end generation/adoption/tooling trace: fresh init, a stale-policy adoption fixture, generated root instructions, and `check-agent-tooling --json` must all work without a gstack route or runtime probe.

## Root Cause Evidence

Not applicable: this is an approved breaking migration, not a bugfix profile.

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260713-1305-remove-gstack-core.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todos.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260713-1305-remove-gstack-core.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20260713-1305-remove-gstack-core.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: `repo-harness run verify-sprint` must see this contract pass, the review recommend pass, and `## External Acceptance Advice` pass or record a manual override.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: parent agent owns product and complex/design planning; `geju` is used before capture; Waza/gbrain/CodeGraph lanes remain unchanged.
- Edge cases: a stale generated policy is cut over directly; user-local skill directories are untouched; historical evidence remains provenance only.
- Regression risks: source/mirror drift, adoption preserving retired managed values, translated README drift, or tooling JSON consumers expecting the deleted `tools.gstack` field.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: final work-package commit on `codex/remove-gstack-core`.
- Revert strategy: revert the single migration commit; no compatibility path is retained.
