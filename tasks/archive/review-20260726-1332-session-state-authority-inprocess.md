## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass
- Change type: bugfix
- Intended files changed: five hook/runtime source files, five focused test/fixture surfaces, and this package's four workflow artifacts; no telemetry, mutation-observed, prompt-handler, root-context, current-status, or todo surface
- Actual files changed: exactly the intended 14 paths; `review-subject` reports ten production/test subject paths, four excluded workflow artifacts, and zero target-overlap paths against `main` at `998cb519`
- Commands passed: focused 70-test matrix (70 pass / 0 fail), full `bun test` (2078 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail), fresh strict acceptance verification (35/35; full suite 570214 ms), `bun run check:type`, deploy SQL, architecture sync (zero blocking drift), task sync, strict workflow validation, project-state inspection, adopt dry-run (zero operations), and `git diff --check`
- Residual risks: Claude Code produced no verdict in three independent 330-second attempts (full scope, canonical subject, and tool-free static subject); the contract owner explicitly accepted that bounded reviewer-unavailability risk through the recorded `user_waiver`
- Reviewer action required: none; the valid user-waiver AcceptanceReceipt and fresh passing evidence are recorded
- Rollback: revert/discard this single work-package diff; no migration, persisted schema bump, or compatibility state exists

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: approved bugfix work-package in the contract worktree; Waza `/check`-style deep self-review after implementation
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: P1 maps SessionStart handler/runtime, Effective State resolver, budget evidence owner, and advisory providers; P2 traces `runHook` -> collector -> in-process resolve -> typed outcome -> mandatory section/diagnostic -> budget evidence -> host output; P3 preserves the old CLI-equivalent empty risk input, PreEdit retry terminal semantics, handler-failed invariant, healthy byte parity, and HRD `child_processes` meaning without a new authority or runtime option
- Root cause or plan evidence: contract four-field Root Cause Evidence plus `.ai/harness/runs/session-state-authority-inprocess-pre-fix.log` (`PRE_FIX_EXIT=1`); the plan's duplicated captured design was removed before source edits

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: `check` skill applied in this session; full diff and execution paths reviewed against the contract after all tests passed
- Commands run: see Human Review Card; strict verifier independently executed every listed focused test and command and promoted the contract to `Fulfilled`
- Manual checks: all three exact contract rows are checked below with concrete evidence
- Supporting artifacts: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`; `.ai/harness/runs/session-state-authority-inprocess-pre-fix.log`; `tests/fixtures/session-start/state-authority-baseline.json`; preserved final verifier log under `/tmp` for this worktree session
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes — CLI-equivalent risk-input correction, retry ownership, failure-only evidence shape, metric boundary, plan deduplication, and verification observation
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/runs/`

## Manual Check Evidence

- [x] Healthy SessionStart additional context and protocol-1 evidence are byte-identical to the captured pre-change fixture
  - Evidence: `tests/session-state-authority.test.ts` compared a path-independent fixture captured from base and current runtime; exact context, bytes, tokens, evidence, and telemetry matched.
- [x] Resolver failure emits bounded mandatory HarnessStateUnavailable context while runHook returns ok
  - Evidence: isolated Bun module-failure cases covered transient exhaustion and non-transient throws; both returned exitCode 0 reason ok with mandatory actionable unavailable context and hashed evidence only.
- [x] child_processes retains direct route-runtime child semantics and remains zero in typed route characterization
  - Evidence: `tests/hook-runtime-characterization.test.ts` passed with SessionStart state_resolutions 1 and child_processes 0; HRD-08 telemetry and diet-report characterization tests also passed.

- Summary: Accepted bounded closeout risk after three Claude Code review attempts produced no verdict within the 330-second gate; local contract verification is 35/35 and the normalized subject is sha256:78fbe9a2d7f0a9da0079bb23dcd320b98fa2adea5b2e03e498978cf2aa358b90.
- Findings: none

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Healthy SessionStart output is byte-identical to the captured pre-change fixture, but Effective State is now resolved directly through the typed in-process authority instead of a self-CLI subprocess.
- Successful non-actionable state produces no state section; successful blocked state remains an actionable `[HarnessState]`; resolver failure produces mandatory `[HarnessStateUnavailable]` plus bounded hashed evidence while the host hook still returns `ok`.
- Each of the eight advisory providers remains independently fail-open for model context, but an omitted provider now emits one normalized hashed diagnostic and later siblings continue. Diagnostic-only events still reach the budget evidence writer.
- PreEdit retains one-attempt non-transient null mapping and three-attempt residual-transient rethrow mapping. `child_processes` remains the frozen direct route-runtime metric and is characterized as zero after self-CLI removal.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Claude external acceptance was unavailable after three bounded attempts; the contract's explicitly allowed `user_waiver` path is recorded and verified, without representing the unavailable review as an external pass.
- Provider diagnostics deliberately persist only provider id, reason code, and an error hash; operators must rerun the named `required_action` to obtain live raw diagnostics.
- Two verifier runs lost the underlying full-suite log and returned aggregate exit 1. The independent full suite, exact detached bounded runner, and final preserved-log exact verifier sequence all passed; this remains a verifier observability concern, not a reproduced product defect.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 9/10 | Healthy parity and both terminal failure classes are exercised end to end |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Mandatory state can no longer disappear without model context and persisted evidence |
| Design quality | 9/10 | One typed authority, one shared retry helper, adapter-owned terminal semantics, no parallel protocol |
| Code quality | 9/10 | 2078-test full suite green; focused red-first guard and bounded privacy assertions |

## Failing Items

- none

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `repo-harness run verify-contract --contract tasks/contracts/20260725-2254-session-state-authority-inprocess.contract.md --strict`
- Re-check: `bun test tests/session-state-authority.test.ts tests/session-context.test.ts tests/harness-context-budget.test.ts tests/hook-runtime-characterization.test.ts tests/state/effective-state-stability.test.ts tests/unit/hrd-08-event-telemetry-and-benchmark.test.ts tests/hook-dispatch-diet-report.test.ts`; then recompute `review-subject` before recording acceptance

## Summary

- Pass. SessionStart now uses the existing Effective State authority in-process, preserves healthy output bytes, gives resolver unavailability a bounded fail-closed representation, records privacy-safe diagnostics even when no section survives, and leaves PreEdit/Stop plus HRD metric semantics intact. The contract is `Fulfilled`; fresh acceptance evidence and a truthful user-waiver receipt close the unavailable Claude-review gate.
