## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass
- Change type: code-change
- Intended files changed: `src/cli/runtime/helper-runner.ts:13` constant; the two pinned assertions at `tests/unit/closeout-runner-guardrails.test.ts:121-122`
- Actual files changed: exactly that, plus the `tasks/todos.md` ledger header. 3 modified (+4 -4) and 4 new workflow artifacts (plan/contract/notes/review). Every path is inside `allowed_paths`. `CLOSEOUT_HELPER_TIMEOUT_MS` and `ORDINARY_HELPER_TIMEOUT_MS` are untouched, as the contract requires.
- Commands passed: `bun run check:type`; `bun test tests/unit/closeout-runner-guardrails.test.ts` (24 pass / 0 fail); `grep -q '1_260_000' src/cli/runtime/helper-runner.ts`; `bash scripts/check-task-sync.sh`
- Residual risks: see Residual Risks / Follow-ups
- Reviewer action required: none
- Rollback: revert the single commit; the wrapper returns to 720_000 together with its two pinned assertions. No migration involved.

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: acceptance gate review of the full working-tree diff against the contract.
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: P1 - two independent ceilings guard a verification round. The inner one is the shell gate's own whole-round deadline (`scripts/verify-contract.sh:5`, raised to 1_200_000 by `a8b9b73e`); the outer one is this process wrapper in the CLI runtime, applied by `helperTimeoutMs()` at `src/cli/runtime/helper-runner.ts:129-141`. P2 - traced which ceiling actually fired in the two blocked bundle rounds: the kill message was `process timed out after 720000ms` with ELAPSED 720/721s, and no run snapshot was written, which is the wrapper's signature - the inner gate always writes a snapshot and a `budget_ms` field before failing. P3 - the ordering invariant is the real content of this change: an outer backstop must sit strictly above the inner gate, otherwise the gate that produces evidence can never fire for long rounds and every such round degrades into a mute process kill. 1_260_000 = 1_200_000 + 60s margin preserves that ordering with the smallest coherent number.
- Root cause or plan evidence: Task Profile is `code-change`, so the Root Cause Evidence block is not required.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: not run as a separate skill; the contract exit criteria plus an independent sibling sweep were run directly.
- Commands run:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `bun run check:type` | exit 0 |
| `bun test tests/unit/closeout-runner-guardrails.test.ts` | 24 pass / 0 fail, 128 expect() calls |
| `grep -q '1_260_000' src/cli/runtime/helper-runner.ts` | exit 0 |
| `bash scripts/check-task-sync.sh` | exit 0 |

- Manual checks:
  - Sibling sweep for the old constant across `*.ts`/`*.sh`/`*.json`/`*.md` (excluding archives and runtime state): no live `720_000` or `720000` remains. Every surviving hit is prose in this task's own plan/contract/notes or in the archived budget review that predicted this follow-up. This is the check that caught the stale projection in the previous work-package, so it was run first here.
  - Projection check: `helper-runner.ts` has no counterpart under `assets/templates/helpers/` (`find` returns the single `src/cli/runtime/helper-runner.ts`). Unlike the shell helpers, this file is not part of the scripts/ ↔ assets/ projection set, so the drift guard added in the budget work-package does not apply and no second copy needed syncing.
  - Consumer check: `helperTimeoutMs()` (`src/cli/runtime/helper-runner.ts:129-141`) routes only `verify-contract` and `verify-sprint` to the raised constant; `contract-worktree`, `merge-gate`, and `ship-worktrees` still map to `CLOSEOUT_HELPER_TIMEOUT_MS` (900_000) and everything else to `ORDINARY_HELPER_TIMEOUT_MS` (120_000). The blast radius is exactly the two verifier helpers.
  - Ordering invariant confirmed numerically: outer wrapper 1_260_000 > inner whole-round budget 1_200_000, margin 60_000 ms.
- Supporting artifacts: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`, `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Implementation notes reviewed: `tasks/notes/20260805-2041-verifier-wrapper-1260s.notes.md` - the sizing rationale matches the measured kills I observed directly (ELAPSED 720/721s, mute `process timed out after 720000ms`, no snapshot).
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/runs/`

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Verifier helpers (`verify-contract`, `verify-sprint`) may now run up to 1260s before the CLI runtime kills the process, instead of 720s.
- The practical effect is which ceiling fires for a 720-1200s round: previously the wrapper killed it mutely, with no run snapshot, no `budget_ms`, and nothing to attribute the failure to. Now the inner gate reaches its own deadline first and fails with a `verification_budget` failure class plus a written snapshot.
- Nothing else moves: closeout and ordinary helper timeouts, the inner budget, the deadline arithmetic, and the fail-closed semantics are all unchanged.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- `CLOSEOUT_HELPER_TIMEOUT_MS = 900_000` (`src/cli/runtime/helper-runner.ts:14`) still sits below the 1_200_000 inner budget, so the same inversion class exists one level up for closeout helpers. It is not reachable today: `contract-worktree finish` finalizes acceptance without rerunning verification (observed directly in the previous work-package's finish output, `Sprint acceptance finalized without rerunning verification`), so no closeout helper currently hosts a full verification round. If a closeout path ever triggers one, this same mute-kill failure mode returns. Explicitly out of scope for this contract; worth a follow-up only if that coupling appears.
- This raises a ceiling; it does not make rounds faster. A full round measures ~525s at low load and exceeded 720s under ambient multi-agent load. If the suite keeps growing, the next pressure point is the inner 1200s budget, and the right response then is suite runtime, not another ceiling bump.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 9/10 | Restores the ordering invariant with the minimum coherent number and syncs the assertions that pin it |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Fixes the failure *mode* (mute kill with no evidence), not just the threshold |
| Design quality | 9/10 | Wrapper stays a last-resort backstop; the evidence-emitting gate stays the authority |
| Code quality | 9/10 | One constant, two pinned assertions, no new indirection |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test tests/unit/closeout-runner-guardrails.test.ts`; `bun run check:type`
- Re-check: `grep -n 'VERIFIER_HELPER_TIMEOUT_MS\|CLOSEOUT_HELPER_TIMEOUT_MS' src/cli/runtime/helper-runner.ts` and confirm the wrapper is still strictly above the inner budget in `scripts/verify-contract.sh:5`.

## Summary

PASS. The diff is exactly the contract Goal: `VERIFIER_HELPER_TIMEOUT_MS` moves from 720_000 to 1_260_000 and the two assertions that pin it move with it. I ran the sibling sweep first, because a stale second copy is precisely what made the previous work-package fail review: no live `720_000` remains anywhere, and `helper-runner.ts` has no `assets/templates/helpers/` counterpart to sync. `helperTimeoutMs()` routes only the two verifier helpers to this constant, so the blast radius is bounded, and closeout/ordinary budgets are untouched as scoped. The change restores the invariant that matters - outer backstop strictly above the inner gate, 60s margin - so a long round now fails through the gate that writes evidence instead of dying as a mute process kill. Recommendation: pass.

- Summary: Gatekeeper PASS. The diff is exactly the contract Goal: VERIFIER_HELPER_TIMEOUT_MS moves 720_000 to 1_260_000 at src/cli/runtime/helper-runner.ts:13 and the two pinned assertions at tests/unit/closeout-runner-guardrails.test.ts:121-122 move with it. Sibling sweep run first (the miss that failed the previous work-package's first round): no live 720_000/720000 remains anywhere, and helper-runner.ts has no assets/templates/helpers counterpart to sync. helperTimeoutMs() routes only verify-contract and verify-sprint to this constant; closeout 900_000 and ordinary 120_000 are untouched as scoped. Ordering invariant restored numerically: outer wrapper 1_260_000 > inner whole-round budget 1_200_000, 60s margin, so a long round now fails through the evidence-emitting gate instead of a mute process kill. Exit criteria: check:type 0, closeout-runner-guardrails 24 pass/0 fail, grep 0, check-task-sync 0; verify round total=9 failed=0 Fulfilled with budget_ms 1200000.
