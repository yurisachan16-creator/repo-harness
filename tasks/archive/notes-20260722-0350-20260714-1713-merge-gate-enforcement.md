## Design Decisions

- The actual choke point is `contract-worktree finish`, not the earlier review artifact: the gate runs only after finish has produced the exact candidate commit.
- The host-only `merge-gatekeeper` agent is a tool-free runtime wrapper only. The cross-host fleet `gatekeeper` remains unchanged; the `merge-gate` skill is the sole enforcement review/output authority, and `scripts/merge-gate.ts` is the only receipt writer.
- The exact target base commit owns gate enablement. The OS account home's `~/.repo-harness/config.json#merge_gate` owns the absolute Claude binary, agent, and skill identity; protected helper resolution ignores caller HOME/source/helper overrides, so candidate policy and environment variables cannot replace them.
- The receipt lives under host state and binds repository root, base ref/SHA, head SHA, binary-diff SHA-256, host-runtime fingerprint (config, binary identity, agent, skill), and installed-helper fingerprint. It has no time-based freshness heuristic.
- Claude receives no tools and starts in an empty temporary directory. The trusted orchestrator supplies complete goal/diff/evidence bytes over stdin; deterministic commands run before the semantic gate and the gate never executes candidate code or reads candidate paths.
- The Claude runner does not set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`: explicitly setting it to the default-looking user path made Claude Code 2.1.209 ignore the existing macOS login, while the same allowlisted environment with ordinary `HOME` authenticated correctly. The runner still loads only user settings from the OS-account home.
- The agent frontmatter intentionally omits `tools: []`; Claude Code treated that declaration as disabling its hidden structured-output mechanism and returned plain JSON despite `--json-schema`. The orchestrator-owned CLI flag `--tools ""` remains the enforceable tool-denial boundary and the live schema canary now returns `structured_output`.
- Official protected-helper execution pins Bash, Git, Bun, and `gh` to installed host paths, overwrites caller tool variables, and replaces caller `PATH`; direct helper execution is not an authority boundary.
- Local merge preflight is read-only and rejects every dirty target state. It never removes even byte-identical untracked target files before a PASS verdict.
- Install `merge-gate` only to Claude; do not create a Codex skill projection or provider fallback.

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

- Enforcement moved from only `ship-worktrees` to the earlier `contract-worktree finish` commit/merge boundary, with an additional ship recheck. FAIL/BLOCKED now rolls finish back to the pre-finish commit and restores active workflow artifacts.
- PR mode fetches the exact remote target before review and pushes the verified SHA explicitly. Local merge also names the verified SHA rather than a mutable branch ref.

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Gate before finish | Rejected | The worktree is not yet represented by an immutable head SHA and finish would invalidate the receipt by committing. |
| Gate after candidate commit | Selected | The receipt identifies the exact push/merge candidate and can be revalidated without a lock service; a rejected verdict rolls the finish transaction back. |
| GitHub required check | Deferred | Local agent-driven ship is the only authorized path in this slice. |
| Agent and skill with the same name | Rejected | `merge-gatekeeper` names the runtime identity; `merge-gate` names the reusable protocol. |

## Open Questions

- None. The installed-package live Claude canary returned PASS and the installed helper immediately revalidated the SHA/diff-bound receipt.

## PR Review Remediation

- **P1 map**: Protected helper execution crosses `helper-runner.ts` into the shared process runner; PR shipping crosses `ship-worktrees.sh` into the inner `contract-worktree.sh` closeout transaction; runtime installation crosses `runInit` / strict global setup into host-scoped skills and agents. These are the three mutation/authority boundaries corrected in this pass.
- **P2 trace**: Caller `BASH_ENV` entered `runHelper`, was scrubbed by `protectedChildEnv`, then was incorrectly restored by `runProcess` merging `process.env`. The process runner now supports exact-environment execution and both protected Git root resolution and helper execution opt out of inheritance. A direct `runHelper` regression proves the shell hook is not executed.
- **P2 trace**: PR ship now snapshots the pre-finish branch plus live `plans`, `tasks`, active markers, sprint state, and plan state before `finish --no-merge`. If the second target fetch invalidates the receipt or exact-SHA push fails, the outer transaction restores the branch and workflow artifacts. The integration fixture advances remote `main` during Claude review, observes fail-closed rollback before push, restores external state, and retries successfully.
- **P3 decision**: Keep the inner finish transaction as the commit/gate boundary and add one outer PR-ship transaction around finish, refetch, receipt verification, and push. This is the smallest boundary that makes the whole local mutation sequence retryable; PR creation remains after commit because an external PR side effect cannot be rolled back locally.
- **P3 decision**: Cross-review skills keep their caller-HOME/external-skill lifecycle. The required merge-gate skill and agent are installed independently after a successful adoption (and in strict global setup) using the same OS-account-home authority model as the gate runtime. The test-only dependency seam is internal to library calls and is not a CLI/environment fallback.
- **Verification**: `bun test` passed `1461 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail` across 114 files in 542.60s. Typecheck, focused security/transaction/installer tests, Bash syntax, and helper projection parity pass. An isolated `npm pack` + Bun global install contained the merge-gate skill, agent, and helper, and the installed CLI successfully ran the protected `merge-gate fingerprint` path.
- **External acceptance disposition**: the refreshed `claude-review` attempt exited 1 with `You've hit your session limit · resets 12:30am (Asia/Taipei)`. On 2026-07-15 the repository owner explicitly directed this PR to skip Claude review and continue through GitHub CI, merge, and branch cleanup. This is an owner-directed review skip, not an external PASS and not a synthetic manual-override result.
- **Linux CI fixture correction**: the PR ship rollback fixture cloned a bare remote without naming `main`; Linux resolved the bare remote's default branch differently, and the fixture's fake Claude script lacked `set -e`, so the intended remote-main advance failed silently. The fixture now uses `set -eu` and `git clone --branch main`, making the same base-movement condition deterministic on macOS and Linux.
- **Reverification**: the corrected focused ship fixture passed. The full `check:ci` test phase also completed with zero test failures; its only non-test failure was `check-task-sync`, because this CI correction had not yet been recorded in a tracked task artifact. This notes update closes that synchronization requirement; the workflow-only tail is rerun separately rather than repeating the already-green full test matrix.
- **Contract closeout**: strict contract verification passed all 19 criteria and marked the contract `Fulfilled`; task sync, strict task workflow, deploy SQL order, architecture advisory, project inspection, and adoption dry-run also pass.

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.

## Promotion Candidates

- Promote to `tasks/lessons.md` only after a repeated correction or failure pattern.
- Promote to `docs/researches/` only when it is durable repo knowledge with evidence.
- Promote to harness asset files only after verification across more than one task or fixture.
