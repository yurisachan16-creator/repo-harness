## Human Review Card

- Verdict: pass — ship as the work-package terminal state
- Change type: code-change (prose convention + routing registration + one-line adoption defaults + one test assertion)
- Intended files changed: design-options.md (assets+docs mirrors), agentic-development-flow.md (both copies), .ai/harness/policy.json routing key, root CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md single clause, standard-plan.ts (shipped-set line + routing default entry), tests/cli/adoption-plan.test.ts assertion, workflow ledger files
- Actual files changed: exactly the intended set; workflow-contract JSON pair correctly left untouched (closed interface, fail-closed decline)
- Commands passed: bun test (1405 pass / 1 skip / 1 pre-existing out-of-scope fail), check:type, docs show design-options, adopt --repo . --dry-run, check-task-sync, check-architecture-sync, check-task-workflow --strict
- External acceptance: three independent lines — gatekeeper acceptance gate PASS (zero blocking); harness-evaluator adoption-inspection disposable smoke EVAL: PASS (single additive op vs baseline, no orphan routing); Codex cross-model review FAIL with two findings, adjudicated: P1 (gstack test failure) overruled — provenance proven pre-existing on main (ca15eff1 release-prep; branch diff for that file empty); P2 (generated downstream policy.json missing the routing key) ACCEPTED and fixed at e5e5b424 with generated-state proof via direct planner probe on fresh-repo and merge paths
- Residual risks: scripts/lib/project-init-lib.sh carries a second, independent hardcoded copy of the default routing map (bootstrap path) still at six keys — pre-existing dual authority, out of this contract's Allowed Paths, flagged for a follow-up decision; the routing-trigger reliability of a convention row vs a host-surfaced skill remains the plan's stated MEDIUM sub-decision (skill is an evidence-gated fast-follow if proactivity proves weak)
- Reviewer action required: none — terminal
- Rollback: revert the branch; prose/config plus two one-line source edits; no data migration; BDD2/EA1/PS1 evidence untouched

## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: plan-to-todo -> contract worktree -> DO-01..03 single implementation dispatch -> DO-04 three-line acceptance (gatekeeper + install smoke + cross-model review) -> adjudicated fix -> ship
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: plan front-matter (host-plan, merge_boundary work-package); taxonomy scout in the plan's architecture map; terminal state = merged convention + green checks + this review
- Root cause or plan evidence: falsifier proven before authoring (docs show resolves reference-configs by filename stem, zero code needed); cross-review P2 fixed with a one-line default-map entry + regression assertion

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: superseded by the three-line DO-04 acceptance above
- Commands run: see Human Review Card; install smoke ran the guarded adoption-inspection profile in a disposable repo+HOME (subject 7408f371 vs baseline ca15eff1: adopt-plan delta exactly one writeFile for docs/reference-configs/design-options.md; inspector output byte-identical)
- Manual checks: zero recommendation language in the convention (gatekeeper hard scan + Codex independent scan both clean); authority ceiling verbatim as frozen; assets/docs mirrors byte-identical; root CLAUDE.md == AGENTS.md
- Supporting artifacts: assets/reference-configs/design-options.md (+docs mirror), routing row in agentic-development-flow.md, policy.json design_options_choice key, standard-plan.ts defaults, tests/cli/adoption-plan.test.ts assertion
- Implementation notes reviewed: tasks/notes/20260714-1353-design-options-proactive-choice.notes.md
- Run snapshot: adoption dry-run 126 ops / 0 failed / 0 warnings; generated policy routing keys = 7 including design_options_choice

## External Acceptance Advice

> **External Acceptance**: pass
> **External Reviewer**: gatekeeper (Opus route) + harness-evaluator (adoption-inspection) + Codex cross-model (gpt-5.6 via codex CLI)
> **External Source**: DO-04 three-line acceptance, this session
> **External Started**: 2026-07-14 15:10
> **External Completed**: 2026-07-14 16:00

- P1 blockers: none remaining (Codex P1 adjudicated pre-existing/out-of-scope with provenance; Codex P2 fixed at e5e5b424 and re-verified)
- P2 advisories: project-init-lib.sh duplicate routing map (residual, follow-up candidate)
- Acceptance checklist: convention completeness per plan spec; no killed surface resurrected (both reviewers confirm); registration coherence across table/policy/root; downstream discoverability proven in disposable state; generated-policy parity proven on both planner paths

## Behavior Diff Notes

- The agent may now proactively route a genuine multi-direction visual/UX decision through the design-options convention: browser reference evidence under authority ceilings, 2-3 ImageGen variants labeled STIMULUS, neutral presentation with the mandatory not-concluding statement, user closes, pick recorded as user_evidence, absent user = STOP.
- No enforcement machinery exists anywhere: ceilings are guidance prose; tools are host capabilities; the convention is reachable via `repo-harness docs show design-options` on self-host and downstream.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- scripts/lib/project-init-lib.sh bootstrap routing map still six keys (second hardcoded authority; pre-existing; out of scope here) — candidate one-line follow-up plus its runtime test expectation.
- Pre-existing main failure: tests/retired-planning-provider.test.ts vs assets/skill-version.json:205 ("gstack" inside the 0.10.0 changelog description) — belongs to the release-prep line, not this work-package.
- Convention-row proactivity vs a host-surfaced skill: evidence-gated fast-follow if firing proves weak in practice.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 9/10 | Convention complete per spec; discoverable self-host and downstream; generated-policy parity proven |
| Product depth | 8/10 | First product surface from the BDD line; constraints from three sealed rounds encoded as DNA |
| Design quality | 9/10 | Smallest honest artifact set; fail-closed decline on the closed interface; zero recommendation language |
| Code quality | 8/10 | Two one-line source edits, pattern-consistent; regression assertion added; content-contract tests untouched and green |

## Failing Items

- none

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun src/cli/index.ts docs show design-options && bun test tests/cli/adoption-plan.test.ts tests/cli/docs.test.ts`
- Re-check: `bash scripts/check-task-sync.sh && bash scripts/check-architecture-sync.sh`

## Summary

- The design-options convention ships as the first product surface from the BDD line: a prose procedure doc plus three-point routing registration and adoption-pipeline parity, with the human-closure contract (agent presents, user picks, choice recorded as user_evidence) encoded exactly as the sealed-experiment constraints demand. Three independent acceptance lines converged; the one accepted cross-review finding was fixed and re-proven; no killed surface returns.
