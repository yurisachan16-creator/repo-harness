## Design Decisions

- Sizing evidence: three consecutive verification rounds died at `exit=124`, the whole-round deadline kill from `VERIFICATION_BUDGET_MS` in `scripts/verify-contract.sh:5` (snapshots under `.ai/harness/runs/`). `bun test` alone measured 595-597s under ambient load against the old 600000 ms whole-round budget, so the suite was consuming essentially the entire round allowance and any co-resident check pushed the round over. 1200000 ms is roughly 2x the worst measured full round, which restores headroom for the rest of the round without turning the budget into a no-op.
- Raised in its own work-package rather than inside the bundle shipment it was blocking, so the gate constant is not edited by the change it is verifying.
- Constant only. The deadline arithmetic at `scripts/verify-contract.sh:635` and the `budget_ms` field emitted at `scripts/verify-contract.sh:555` both read this one constant, so no other line needed to move.

## Gate Findings Remediated

The first pass changed only `scripts/verify-contract.sh` and the gate returned FAIL on two concrete misses, both fixed here:

1. **Projection copy left stale.** `assets/templates/helpers/verify-contract.sh` is the shipped projection of the repo's own `scripts/` helper — downstream repos receive the assets copy while this repo runs the scripts copy. It was byte-identical to `scripts/verify-contract.sh` at HEAD (both `sha256:f5485c8528046936…`), so raising only one side meant every downstream install would keep the 600000 ms budget with nothing failing locally. Both copies now read `VERIFICATION_BUDGET_MS=1200000` and `cmp` reports them byte-identical again.
2. **Pinned assertion still asserted the old value.** `tests/unit/verifier-evidence-lifecycle-cutover.test.ts:123` asserted `toContain('VERIFICATION_BUDGET_MS=600000')`. Updated to `1200000`. This is the test that would have caught finding 1 had it also read the assets copy — it reads only `scripts/`, which is why the new drift guard exists rather than a second constant assertion.

## Helper Projection Pair Enumeration

52 filenames exist in both `scripts/` and `assets/templates/helpers/`. Measured byte-equality at baseline (`git show HEAD:` on both sides) before asserting anything:

- **51 pairs byte-identical → asserted** by `tests/unit/helper-projection-drift.test.ts`. The test enumerates the intersection at runtime rather than hard-coding names, so helper pairs added later are covered automatically.
- **1 pair divergent at baseline → excluded, not asserted**: `capability-resolver.ts` (scripts 12,646 bytes / assets 27,719 bytes; `sha256:35621af59bd68052…` vs `sha256:770ac4634bff32be…`). The assets copy is a generated standalone Bun projection of `src/core/capabilities/registry.ts` — it carries its own `@generated-from … sha256:` provenance header and inlines the registry that the scripts copy imports. Intentionally a different shape, not drift. Recorded in the test's `NOT_BYTE_COPIES` map with that reason, and a companion test asserts every exclusion is still a real, still-divergent pair so a converged pair cannot sit in the list silently un-guarding a real copy.

## Execution Path Fact (out of scope, orchestration-level decision)

The gate found a machine-wide `REPO_HARNESS_SOURCE_ROOT` exported from `~/.zshenv` that points helper resolution at the globally installed package rather than the current checkout. That means a helper edited in a worktree is not necessarily the helper a local verification round executes, which can mask or fake both directions of this fix. Recorded here as a known execution-path hazard; `~/.zshenv` is explicitly out of this contract's scope and the decision belongs at orchestration level.

## Deviations From Plan Or Spec

- None recorded.

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option | Decision | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| ... | ... | ... |

## Open Questions

- None.

## Evidence Links

- Checks: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`

## Promotion Filter

Promote a candidate to `tasks/lessons.md`, `docs/researches/`, or harness asset files only when all three hold: hard to reverse, surprising without local context, and a real trade-off existed. If any one is missing, keep it in this notes file instead.

## Promotion Candidates

- Promote to `tasks/lessons.md` only after a repeated correction or failure pattern.
- Promote to `docs/researches/` only when it is durable repo knowledge with evidence.
- Promote to harness asset files only after verification across more than one task or fixture.
